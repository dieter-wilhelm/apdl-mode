* Introduction
  APDL ([[https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ansys_Parametric_Design_Language][Ansys Parametric Design Language]]) is the solver scripting
  language of the mechanical FEA (Finite Element Analysis) suite [[http://www.ansys.com][Ansys]]
  (ANalysis SYStem, registered TM).

  APDL-Mode (formerly Ansys-Mode) is - in conjunction with the
  GNU-Emacs editor - an advanced APDL environment with features like,
  pin-pointing the APDL reference documentation, keyword completion,
  code templates, dedicated highlighting, solver communication
  (GNU-Linux only), license reporting, etc.  Over the years it has
  accumulated lots of features for writing and debugging FEA complete
  models in APDL code. Please convince yourself with the APDL-Mode
  in-depth documentation.

  With the advent of the modern Ansys GUIs - like `WorkBench' or
  `Discovery AIM' - the usage of APDL as a wholesale modelling
  language has diminished for non automated tasks.  But APDL is here
  to stay: `WorkBench' and `AIM' operate exclusively the Ansys solver
  with it!  They are producing and sending APDL input (.dat) files to
  the solver.  For a true understanding of the GUIs' inner workings a
  study of their APDL code is prerequisite!  Moreover, the GUIs are
  not supporting all solver features.  So "Command (APDL)" snippets
  are used to enhance the GUIs' modelling capabilities.

  Nowadays I find APDL-Mode mostly useful for studying solver (.dat)
  files which were created by WorkBench.  And, especially, for writing
  WorkBench `Command' snippets and inspecting longer snippets from
  other sources.  Accessing swiftly the Ansys APDL reference
  documentation alone is worth using APDL-Mode!

  When you "Export" (or "Import") such a WorkBench Command (APDL)
  object it becomes associated with a file and is editable with a
  third party editor.

  [[file:doc/connect_command_snippet_to_file.png]]

  When you have modified the file then the "File Status" in Workbench
  changes and you can pull-in the updated content with the "Refresh"
  button.

* Some Highlights
** In-built APDL command help with argument counter
   Especially for commands with a large number of arguments it is
   cumbersome to count the arguments, *C-?* facilitates this for you
   and visualises dynamically at which parameter position your cursor
   currently is.

   [[file:doc/parameter_help2.png]]

** Pin-pointing the relevant Ansys documentation
   You can trigger (*C-c C-b*) the relevant Ansys manual entry
   directly from your APDL-Mode session without the detour of
   searching in the Ansys online help (default since V19).  This works
   not only for APDL commands but also element names and other manual
   topics. (To that end you must have started / registered the Ansys
   online help once from an Ansys product.  But I recommend installing
   the Ansys documentation locally, loading is much faster.)

   The image below is showing a manual entry in GNU-Emacs's EWW
   browser. You are able to consult the manual side-by-side with your
   APDL code.

** Code outlining for inspecting WorkBench solver (.dat) files
   APDL-Mode hides the normally uninteresting but usually very large
   number blocks.

   The image below shows the unhidden content.

** Command Snippet Templates and Code Highlighting Example
   The image shows GNU-Emacs with a ripped off APDL-Mode menu field,
   the APDL variable buffer, the APDL file itself and an APDL template
   preview.  You are able to compile your most often used WorkBench /
   Discovery AIM Command snippets and have them all immediately
   available for inspection and inclusion.

* Installation
** Melpa
   APDL-Mode is now available on the Emacs package archive [[https://melpa.org/][Melpa]].
   Please add
   #+begin_src elisp
   (add-to-list 'package-archives
	     '("melpa" . "http://melpa.org/packages/") t)
   #+end_src

   to your initialisation file.  Then type: `M-x list-packages', find
   `apdl-mode', mark it with `i' and install it with `x'.

   If you prefer the stable package archive instead of development
   versions use
   #+begin_src elisp
      (add-to-list 'package-archives
      '("melpa-stable" . "http://melpa-stable.milkbox.net/packages/") t)
   #+end_src
   instead as the package source.

** Manual installation
   If you have problems accessing the Melpa archive - for example -
   behind a corporate firewall.  You can install APDL-Mode manually:


   1) Install [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][GNU-Emacs]] first (if you are new to this editor please
      check the tutorial in its `Help' menu, please really do it ;-).
      You should use at least Emacs version 25.1.
   2) Download the latest APDL-Mode's tar package from the [[https://github.com/dieter-wilhelm/apdl-mode/releases/tag/20.1.0][Github]]
      release page.
   3) Install the package in Emacs: Please type `M-x
      package-install-file <RET>' and select the downloaded tar file.


   That's it.


   *Hint:* If you are getting an error message "package.el is not yet
   initialized", you are using Emacs' packaging system for the very
   first time.  It is necessary to initialise this machinery once,
   please type: `M-: (package-initialize) <RET>' and then apply `M-x
   package-install-file <RET>' again.

   APDL-Mode is tested for Ansys v193 and v201, as well as under
   Emacs-25 and 26.

   # For further installation options please have a
   # look in the [[file:INSTALLATION.org][INSTALLATION]] file.

* Usage
  Please type `M-x apdl' which opens a buffer in APDL-Mode and you can
  inspect the menu bar's `APDL' and `Ansys' entries.  Please select
  `Describe APDL-Mode' (or type `C-h m'), which will display the
  mode's help with further guidance.

  You might also check the introductory APDL-Mode tutorial
  ([[file:doc/A-M_introductory_tutorial.org][A-M_introductory_tutorial.org]]) as well.

  The complete [[http://dieter-wilhelm.github.io/apdl-mode][documentation of APDL-Mode]] is available online
* Configuration and Customisation
  Most functionality of APDL-Mode is working without additional
  configurations.  APDL-Mode should be intelligent enough to figure
  out Ansys installation dependent configurations.  (It uses by
  default the highest installed Ansys version.)

  I recommend configuring GNU-Emacs to autoload APDL-Mode for certain
  file endings, especially the `.mac' suffix.  Please read
  [[file:apdl-config.org][apdl-config.org]], or the accompanying configuration file
  [[file:ansys-config.el][apdl-config.el]].
* News
  APDL-Mode uses now for the installation the packaging system of
  GNU-Emacs.  For further news please have a look into the [[file:NEWS.org][NEWS]] file.
