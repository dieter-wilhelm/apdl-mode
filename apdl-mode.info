2 Introduction
**************

APDL (Ansys Parametric Design Language
(https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ansys_Parametric_Design_Language)) is the
solver scripting language of the mechanical FEA (Finite Element
Analysis) suite Ansys (http://www.ansys.com) (ANalysis SYStem,
registered TM).

   APDL-Mode (formerly Ansys-Mode) is - in conjunction with the
GNU-Emacs (https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) editor - an advanced
APDL environment with features like, pin-pointing the APDL reference
documentation, keyword completion, code templates, dedicated
highlighting, solver communication (GNU-Linux only), license reporting,
etc.  Over the years it has accumulated lots of features for writing and
debugging FEA complete models in APDL code.  Please convince yourself
with the APDL-Mode in-depth documentation.

   With the advent of the modern Ansys GUIs - like ‘WorkBench’ or
‘Discovery AIM’ - the usage of APDL as a wholesale modelling language
has diminished for non automated tasks.  But APDL is here to stay:
‘WorkBench’ and ‘AIM’ operate exclusively the Ansys solver with it!
They are producing and sending APDL input (.dat) files to the solver.
For a true understanding of the GUIs’ inner workings a study of their
APDL code is prerequisite!  Moreover, the GUIs are not supporting all
solver features.  So "Command (APDL)" snippets are used to enhance the
GUIs’ modelling capabilities.

   Nowadays I find APDL-Mode mostly useful for studying solver (.dat)
files which were created by WorkBench.  And, especially, for writing
WorkBench ‘Command’ snippets and inspecting longer snippets from other
sources.  Accessing swiftly the Ansys APDL reference documentation alone
is worth using APDL-Mode!

   When you "Export" (or "Import") such a WorkBench Command (APDL)
object it becomes associated with a file and is editable with a third
party editor.  When you have modified the file then the "File Status" in
Workbench changes and you can pull-in the updated content with the
"Refresh" button.

3 First Steps
*************

Please type ‘M-x apdl’ which opens a buffer in APDL-Mode and you can
inspect the menu bar’s ‘APDL’ and ‘MAPDL’ entries.  For existing APDL
files please type ‘M-x apdl-mode’ if the mode is not activated already,
please see the following Configuration section for the pre-configured
file suffixes.

   For further guidance please select the APDL menu ‘APDL-Mode
Documentation’ (or type ‘C-c C-h’) and ‘Describe APDL-Mode’ (or type
‘C-h m’) for the list of its keybindings.  You might also check the
introductory APDL-Mode tutorial (doc/A-M_introductory_tutorial.org).

   APDL-Mode is tested with Ansys v193 and v201 under Windows 10, as
well as under Emacs-25 and 26 under GNU-Linux and Windows.

4 Introductory Tutorial
***********************

This introduction is targeted at users with no GNU-Emacs experience.

   Let’s assume you wrote some APDL command and want to check its
parameters.  In the menu bar use the "APDL" pull-down menu with the
entry "Show APDL Command Help".  The menu shows also the keyboard
shortcut for accessing this command ‘M-?’.  You need to know that
Gnu-Emacs is abreviating certain key sequences M-?  means typing the
control key <ALT> and the regular key ‘?’ simultaneously.

   GNU-Emacs provides also a third, so called interactive way to access
this and other functions.  By typing ‘M-x’ (the <ALT> key and the ‘x’
key at the same time) you are able to access the, so called,
‘minibuffer’ below the status line.  There you can input the desired
function by its name.  In above example the function
‘apdl-show-command-parameters’.  So type ‘M-x’ and in the minibuffer
type ‘apdl-start-ansys-help’ and starting it with the <RET> key.

   Typing long function names can be abbreviated with the
auto-completion feature.  Just enter the first few characters of a
command and then press the <TAB> key.  Another way of saving keystrokes
is to use the Gnu-Emacs’ fuzzy logic.  Instead of typing
‘apdl-show-command-parameter’ it is sufficient to type ‘a-s-c-p’ (and
run it with <RET>).

   You can always cancel minibuffer commands by typing C-g (the function
‘keyboard-quit’), i.  e.  pressing the <CTRL> key and the ‘g’ key at the
same time.

   All functions described in this help, regardless whether possessing a
keyboard shortcut or not, can be called in this interactive way or they
can be found in the APDL or Ansys menu.  (If you prefer to run Emacs in
a terminal window you might access the menu bar with <F10> key or
‘M-‘’.)

   You may have noticed the underlined names in this help.  These are
hyperlinks to further help, a mouse click or typing the <RET> key, when
the cursor is on them (you can skip to these links with the <TAB> key)
will display their respective help strings.

   In case something unintended happend to your code you are always able
to resort to the Emacs ‘undo’ functionality from the "Edit" menu or by
typing ‘C-x u’.

5.1 Finding Help
================

In buffer display of short or browsing the complete Ansys documentation
in a browser.

* Menu:

* Brief Command and Syntax Help::
* APDL Keyword Documentation::


File: apdl-mode.info,  Node: Brief Command and Syntax Help,  Next: APDL Keyword Documentation,  Up: Finding Help

5.1.1 Brief Command and Syntax Help
-----------------------------------

Typing "M-?", the <CTRL> key simultaneously with the <c> key and then
<?>, the question mark (for the command ‘apdl-show-command-parameters’)
displays above a code line a brief description of the APDL command and
its syntax.  This command counts also the number of parameters and
visualises at which parameter position the cursor currently is.  The
command is looking for the next valid command near the cursor or when
using a prefix argument (‘C-u’ or ‘4’) it inquires an APDL command from
you.  The tooltip is switched off with an argument of zero (‘0’).


File: apdl-mode.info,  Node: APDL Keyword Documentation,  Prev: Brief Command and Syntax Help,  Up: Finding Help

5.1.2 APDL Keyword Documentation
--------------------------------

Browse the detailed APDL command, element and selected topics html help.

   typing "C-c C-b" will display the original Ansys help in your web
browser for an APDL command or element name (stating the element number
is sufficient) near the cursor or the code line’s first APDL command.
When using a prefix argument it inquires an keyword from you.  Keywords
beginning with a quotation mark ‘"’ describing general manual sections,
for example typing ‘"SHELLS"’ will call the collection of all shell
elements in the Ansys manual.


File: apdl-mode.info,  Node: Completion,  Next: Code Alignment,  Prev: Finding Help,  Up: Usage and Applications

5.2 Completion
==============

APDL keyword completion (commands, elements, get- and
parametric-functions)

   Type the first letter or letters of an APDL command, function or
element name and use the key binding "C-M-i" to let the function
‘apdl-complete-symbol’ do the (case sensitve) completion for you.
Depending on the case of your letter or letters to be completed, you
will get a downcased, upcased or capitalised completion.

   There are around 2000 APDL symbols available for completion.
Undocumented APDL commands and deprecated element types are also
completed.  The former are identified as such with a different
highlighting and in their ’command syntax help’.  Please see also the
variable ‘apdl-deprecated-element-alist’ it’s a list with the deprecated
elements and their respective replacements (for inspecting its content
please click on above hyperlink or type ‘C-hv’ and then type above
variable name).

   Doing this using the <TAB> key might save you some typing in
auto-completing the name.  When the characters before the cursor are not
unambiguous a completion list is shown, select the suitable word from
the list, either by navigation the cursor over the symbol and typing
<RET> or clicking with the left (or middle) mouse button is completing
the symbol.  Hitting the <SPACE> key removes the listing window.


File: apdl-mode.info,  Node: Code Alignment,  Next: Auto-indentation,  Prev: Completion,  Up: Usage and Applications

5.3 Code Alignment
==================

Formatting of variable definitions:

   Typing "C-c C-a" to call the function ‘apdl-align’ will align marked
sections or a paragraph of variable definitions like the following lines

   xyz=30.381 !this is a variable x = 0.4!this is another variable

   they will be aligned to

   xyz = 30.381 !this is a variable x = 0.4 !this is another variable


File: apdl-mode.info,  Node: Auto-indentation,  Next: Closing of Control Blocks,  Prev: Code Alignment,  Up: Usage and Applications

5.4 Auto-indentation
====================

of looping and conditional blocks.

   You can customise the indentation depth (APDL Block Offset), please
have a look for the entry ’Customise APDL Mode’ in the APDL-Mode menu.
The Emacs customisation facility optionally saves your choices
automatically in your .emacs file for later sessions.


File: apdl-mode.info,  Node: Closing of Control Blocks,  Next: Code Navigation,  Prev: Auto-indentation,  Up: Usage and Applications

5.5 Closing of Control Blocks
=============================

(*do, *if, ...) with the insertion of appropriate end keywords

   Typing "C-c ]" for the function ‘apdl-close-block’ completes the
current APDL block with the insertion of a newline and an appropriate
end keyword.


File: apdl-mode.info,  Node: Code Navigation,  Next: Sophisticated Highlighting,  Prev: Closing of Control Blocks,  Up: Usage and Applications

5.6 Code Navigation
===================

with extended keyboard shortcuts.  Code lines, number blocks, and
*DO,*IF, DOWHILE, *CREATE blocks etc.

   "M-n" – ‘apdl-next-code-line’ and "M-p" – ‘apdl-previous-code-line’
are going to the next/previous code line, skipping intermediate comments
and empty lines.

   The following block navigation commands are analogous to Emacs’
inbuilt list/sexp navigiation.

   "C-M-f" – ‘apdl-next-block-end’ "C-M-b"
–‘apdl-previous-block-start-and-conditional’ Above commands are skipping
to the next/previous block end/start keyword regardless where you are
already in the block structure.  "C-M-b" for the function
‘apdl-previous-block-start-and-conditional’ finds also *IF commands
without bases of the keyword ’THEN’; furthermore *CYCLE and *EXIT
looping controls.  These provide APDL constructs but represent no block
depth and therefore are not considered when applying the following
navigation commands.

   "C-M-n" – ‘apdl-skip-block-forward’ "C-M-p" –
‘apdl-skip-block-backwards’

   Are looking for and skipping over a complete block (at the current
block level, skipping possibly over deeper block structures).

   "C-M-u" – ‘apdl-up-block’ "C-M-d" – ‘apdl-down-block’

   Are searching for and skipping up/down a block structure from the
current block level.

   "C-c {" – ‘apdl-number-block-start’ "C-c }" – ‘apdl-number-block-end’

   Are searching for and skipping over ’pure’ number blocks (the nblock,
eblocks and cmblocks), these are common (and often quite large) in
WorkBench solver input files (*.inp, *.dat).

   You can also hide and unhide these - usually uninteresting - blocks
with M-x apdl-hide-number-blocks and M-x apdl-show-number-blocks
respectively or even a region of your (un)liking with M-x
apdl-hide-region.  In files with the suffix ‘.dat’ number blocks are
hidden by default.

   Moreover there are keyboard shortcuts with which you are able to
input pairs of corresponding characters, like ‘C-c %’ for ’%%’, the APDL
substitution operators.  The advantage is that the cursor is placed
between the pair and you might give a numerical argument to the call and
enclose already existing words with the pair, e.  q.  ‘C-1’ ‘C-c %’.
Please have a look for ‘insert-pair’ and see below in the Keybindings
section.


File: apdl-mode.info,  Node: Sophisticated Highlighting,  Next: Variable Definitions,  Prev: Code Navigation,  Up: Usage and Applications

5.7 Sophisticated Highlighting
==============================

(optionally: User variables)

   The highlighting in the highest decoration level (please refer to
‘apdl-highlighting-level’) tries to follow the idiosyncratic Ansys
solver/interpreter logic as closely as possible.  For example: ’* ’, an
asterisk with following whitespace(s), is still a valid APDL comment
operator (although deprecated, see the Ansys manual for the *LET
command).

   The fontification distinguishes between APDL commands, undocumented
commands, parametric- and get-functions, elements and deprecated
elements.  In case of arbitrary characters after the command names, they
are still highlighted, since these characters are ignored by the Ansys
APDL intepreter.

   A macro is in the Ansys parlance some file with APDL code.  In this
sense it is used in the following documentation.  Additionally you can
create keyboard macros in Emacs to fasten your edinting, please see
‘kmacro-start-macro’.

   APDL macro variables beginning with an underscore might be APDL
reserved variables and therefore are higlighted in a warning face.
Another example is the percent sign, its highlighting reminds you that
the use of such a pair around a parameter name might force a parameter
substitution, e.  g.  with the assignment ’I=5’ and ’/com,TEST%I%’, the
/com command outputs TEST5.

   In the context of pairs of ’%’ characters, you can also input various
pairs with keyboard shortcuts, e.  g.  apostrophies for APDL character
parameters with ‘C-c’, please have a look which bindings are available
with "C-h b" (for ‘describe-bindings’).

   The format strings of *MSG, *MWRITE, *VWRITE and *VREAD are also
highlighted (in decoration levels 2, again please refer to
‘apdl-highlighting-level’).  Below is a summary of the C-format
descriptors which can be used for above commands.  (with these format
descriptors there are no parentheses needed in contrast to less general
fortran ones):

   %I Integer data %F Floating point format %G General numeric format %E
Scientific notation %C,%S Character strings (up to 128 characters) or
arrays; %/ Line break %% Single percent sign %wI w is the column width.
Integer is preceded by the number of blank characters needed to fill the
column.  %0wI Same as above except integer is padded by zeroes instead
of spaces.  %0w.pI Pad integer with zeros as necessary to obtain a
minimum of p digits.  %w.pF w is the column width.  Floating point
format to p decimal places.  %w.pG General format with p significant
digits.  %w.pE Scientific notation to p decimal places.  %wC, %wS
Character string with column width of w.  %-wC, %-wS Left justify
character string (right justify is default).  %wX Include w blank
characters.

   example code: *vwrite,B(1,1),B(2,1) %E%/%E

   Regarding the highlighting of user variables: The idea is to give a
visual hint whether variable names are spelled and used correctly
everywhere not only at the place of its definition.

   For this to occur ‘apdl-highlighting-level’ must be set to 2 (the
maximum, which is also the default), please have a look at the ‘=
customisation =’ section on how to change settings.

   Newly edited variable definitions are taken into account only when
the variable ‘apdl-dynamic-highlighting-flag’ is set (for very large
files this might slow Emacs and therefore the flag is only effective for
files ending in ’.mac’) or every times you activating the variable
display (with "C-c C-v", see below) in the maximum highlighting level
(2).


File: apdl-mode.info,  Node: Variable Definitions,  Next: Abbreviation Facility,  Prev: Sophisticated Highlighting,  Up: Usage and Applications

5.8 Variable Definitions
========================

definition and component names (*GET, *DIM, *SET, = and DO, ...).

   Typing "C-c C-v" (for ‘apdl-display-variables’) shows all definitions
in your APDL file in a separate window.

   You might remove ’*APDL-variables*’ window with "C-x 4 k"
(‘apdl-delete-other-window’).

   When you place the cursor on the respective line number and type
‘C-u’ ‘M-g g’, where ‘C-u’ is a ’prefix’ argument to ‘M-g g’
(‘goto-line’)).  Emacs will then skip to the corresponding definition
line in the macro file.

   Additionally you are able with a prefix argument for "C-c C-v" to
receive the current value of your variables at the cursor position.  For
this functionality it is necessary to have a running Ansys process
(GNU-Linux systems only, please see below the chapter about the solver
communication).


File: apdl-mode.info,  Node: Abbreviation Facility,  Next: Outlining,  Prev: Variable Definitions,  Up: Usage and Applications

5.9 Abbreviation Facility
=========================

for block templates.

   E.g.  typing "‘do" (the backquote ’‘’ then ’do’) and the space key
<SPC> under APDL-Mode triggers an interactive code template which
inserts a *DO loop (‘apdl-do’).  "‘d" (then <SPC>) is a more immediate
version of it without requesting user input (‘ansys_do’).  You can see
all the predefined abbreviations with "‘?", i.  e.  a question mark ’?’
after the backquote ’‘’.  Alternatively you might use the menu entry
"List Mode Abbbreviations" or the command ‘M-x ‘list-abbrevs’ <RET>’ to
inspect all definitions which are defined.


File: apdl-mode.info,  Node: Outlining,  Next: Comment Handling,  Prev: Abbreviation Facility,  Up: Usage and Applications

5.10 Outlining
==============

(hiding and expanding) code sections.

   If you are using the pre-configured APDL-Mode then function
‘outline-minor-mode’ is switched on by default.

   With this mode you can hide certain sections of your code or navigate
to customisable outline headings.  Certain characters –by default ’!@’
(see the variable ‘ansys_outline_string’)– at the beginning of a line in
your code represent such headings.  ’!@@’ specifies a subheading and so
on (please call the function ‘apdl-skeleton-outline-template’ to insert
a skeleton of outline sections in your current file).  Check out the
Outline menu entries.

   In case outlining is not activate you might call Outline Minor Mode
with "M-x outline-minor-mode" or you can enable this mode for the
current session by ticking on the respective option in the menu or
permanently by setting ‘apdl-outline-minor-mode’ for the
‘apdl-mode-hook’ variable.  Please type "M-x apdl-customise-ansys <RET>"
or use the customisaton system from the menu: ->APDL ->Customise APDL
Mode.


File: apdl-mode.info,  Node: Comment Handling,  Next: Code Template,  Prev: Outlining,  Up: Usage and Applications

5.11 Comment Handling
=====================

commenting/un- of whole paragraphs.

   • "M-;" calls ‘comment-dwim’ (Do What I Mean ;-):

   In a code line: This command inserts comment char
‘apdl-indent-comment-string’ at ‘apdl-code-comment-column’ (if feasible,
i.  e.  the code line is not too long).  With a prefix argument: Kill
existing code comment.

   With an highlighted region: Commenting out (‘comment-region’) or
Uncommenting (‘uncomment-region’) that region.

   In an empty line: Inserts ’!!  ’ with the right indentation.

   • "C-M-j" (or "M-j", calls ‘indent-new-comment-line’).

   Breaks a code comment and inserts a single exclamation mark ’!’
(‘apdl-comment-char’) at column ‘apdl-code-comment-column’ (if
possible).

   In comment lines ’!!  ’ with two comment characters
(‘apdl-indent-comment-string’) breaks the comment and begins a the same
comment style at the the current indentation.

   In an empty line or a line without comment: Just inserts a new line.


File: apdl-mode.info,  Node: Code Template,  Next: Auto-insertion,  Prev: Comment Handling,  Up: Usage and Applications

5.12 Code Template
==================

insertion into an APDL file.

   You are able to preview the code templates with "C-c C-s" (for
‘apdl-display-skeleton’), while doing this, you might type <TAB> to
complete all available skeleton names.

   Check e.  g.  ‘apdl-skeleton-outline-template’, type "M-x
apdl-skeleton-outline-template <RET>" to insert this skeleton of APDL
code with outline headings.  Alternatively you can use the binding
"<CTRL> + u M-x apdl-skeleton-outline-template" for inserting templates
instead of previewing them.


File: apdl-mode.info,  Node: Auto-insertion,  Next: Process Management,  Prev: Code Template,  Up: Usage and Applications

5.13 Auto-insertion
===================

of code templates into new APDL files.

   Put the following section in your .emacs file, in case you want to to
include above skeleton (optionally) for every APDL file.

   (auto-insert-mode 1) (add-hook ’find-file-hook ’auto-insert) (setq
auto-insert-query t) (add-to-list ’auto-insert-alist ’(apdl-mode .
[apdl-skeleton-outline-template]))

   Please refere the configuration example ‘default.el’.


File: apdl-mode.info,  Node: Process Management,  Next: MAPDL Solver,  Prev: Auto-insertion,  Up: Usage and Applications

5.14 Process Management
=======================

Even when there is no buffer under APDL-Mode, after starting Emacs, for
example, it is possible to run selected APDL-Mode services.  You might
run the licsense status from the mini-buffer with M-x
‘apdl-license-status’ instead of calling it from the menu or with C-c
C-l in an APDL-Mode buffer.  Here is the list of commands which are
available from the mini-buffer without loading a file under APDL-Mode:

   apdl apdl-mode apdl-user-license-status apdl-license-status

   • APDL-Mode writes for you an APDL stop file in the current directory
     (the file name is compiled from the variable ‘apdl-job’ and the
     extension ’.abt’).  You can do this with "M-x
     apdl-write-abort-file" (‘apdl-write-abort-file’, you might
     previously use the Emacs command ’cd’ ("<ALT> + x M-x cd ") to
     change the current directory).  This stop file is halting a running
     calculation in an orderly, re-startable fashion.

   • You are able to view the Ansys APDL error file (a file consisting
     of the ‘apdl-job’ and the suffix ’.err’ in the current directory)
     with "C-c C-e" (this calls ‘apdl-display-error-file’).  The error
     file is opened in read only mode (see ‘read-only-mode’) and with
     the minor mode ‘auto-revert-tail-mode’, which scrolls the buffer
     automatically for keeping the current Ansys output visible.

   • You can start the Ansys Help Viewer directly from Emacs with "M-x
     apdl-start-ansys-help" (for ‘apdl-start-ansys-help’).

   • You might also start the APDL product launcher from Emacs under
     windows or the APDL interpeter under GNU-Linux with "C-c RET" (for
     ‘apdl-start-ansys’).

   • For displaying the available licenses please use "C-c C-l" (for
     ‘apdl-license-status’).  You will see the status of everything
     available on the license server in the **License** buffer.  In this
     buffer you can apply additional keys, for example ‘o’ to show only
     selected licenses (compiled from the variable
     ‘apdl-license-occur-regexp’).  Please type ‘h’ for a list of
     available keys.

   If your Ansys installation is not in the default locations APDL-Mode
might not be able to find its executables.  Or you want to use mixed
Ansys version installations then it is necessary to customise some
variables.  Either by calling the Emacs customisation facility
‘apdl-customise-ansys’ or from the menu bar -> ’APDL’ -> ’Customise APDL
Mode’ -> ’APDL-process’ and look there for the variables ’Ansys License
File’, ’Ansys Util Program’ and ’Ansys Help Program’ as well as ’Ansys
Help Program Parameters’) or set the variables directly in your .emacs
file.  Please have a look in apdl-config.org and the apdl-config.el
customisation example.

5.15 MAPDL Solver
=================

control and communication (mainly restricted to GNU-Linux systems).

   With the APDL-Mode keyboard shortcut "C-c RET" (for the command
‘apdl-start-ansys’) you can start the APDL solver/interpreter under
GNU-Linux as an asynchronous process of Emacs.  After starting the run
you will see all interpreter output in a separate Emacs ’comint’
(command interpreter) window.  You are now able to interact with this
process in three ways, either by typing directly in the ’*APDL*’ window
or using "C-c C-c" (for ‘apdl-send-to-ansys’).  With the latter you can
send either the current code line or a whole selected region to the
running solver.  (A selected region means highlighted lines of code.  If
there is no running solver the function copies the code to the system
clipboard.)  And lastly you are able to send interactively APDL commands
with "C-c C-q" (‘apdl-query-apdl-command’) without switching to the
’*APDL*’ window.  If you would like to send your current code line in a
slightly modified form, then give a prefix argument to
‘apdl-query-apdl-command’ and the line will be the intial input for
sending it to the interpreter.

   Another very useful function in this context is "C-c C-u"
(‘apdl-copy-or-send-above’), which sends all code from the beginning up
to the current line to the solver/interpreter.  If there is no running
interpreter the function copies the code to the system clipboard.

   The last two commands (‘apdl-copy-or-send-above’ and
‘apdl-send-to-ansys’) are skipping to the next code line (if possible).
If you don’t need this behaviour supply any prefix argument to them and
the cursor will remain in the current line or in the last line of the
previously highlighted region.

   When you are not familiar with Emacs’ keybindings you probably want
to select your part of interest with dragging the mouse pointer while
pressing the first mouse button.  Often it is faster to select regions
with specialised keyboard commands.  For example "C-M-h"
(‘apdl-mark-block’) marks a whole block level, "M-x mark-paragraph
(‘mark-paragraph’) marks the current paragraph, the last command can not
only be used to initialise a new selection but also to extend an
existing one when repeting the command.  Please check the code
navigation commands which APDL-Mode provides (type "C-h b"
(‘describe-bindings’) to see which are available).

   In this mode you are able to start an Ansys graphics screen (without
the rest of graphical user interface) with M-x apdl-start-graphics
(function ‘apdl-start-graphics’).  Thus you are able to check and debug
your macro file content visually.  The graphics in this state is
changeable with APDL commands (like /view,1,1,1,1) but unfortunately not
through mouse interactions!  If you want to turn, zoom, etc., the model
it is best to call ‘apdl-start-pzr-box’ with C-c C-p and a dialog box
will pop up.  This is the usual Ansys Pan/Zoom/Rotate dialog for the
graphics screen.  But beware: Before you are able to send further
commands to the solver, you first have to close the PZR dialog box.
There is also a family of interactive commands to reposition the
graphics, like C-c C-+ (‘apdl-zoom-in’), replotting works with C-c C-r
(‘apdl-replot’) and a fit to the screen with C-c C-f (‘apdl-fit’), of
course, they are available from the menu as well.

   There is also a command for saving the data and ending the solver
run: ‘apdl-exit-ansys’ and a command for an emergency kill in case the
solver is not stoppable any longer in an orderly way: ‘apdl-kill-ansys’.

   As already indicated APDL-Mode has its own command for invoking the
Ansys Help Viewer "M-x apdl-start-ansys-help" because unfortunately the
following APDL commands do not work when the complete GUI system of
Ansys is not active.

   /ui,help !is it not working in Ansys non-GUI modes help, COMMAND !is
also not working in Ansys non-GUI modes

   So you are not able start the Help Viewer for a *specific* APDL
command but must search within the Ansys Help Viewer or better use the
much faster "C-c C-b".

6 Configuration and Customisation
*********************************

Most functionality of APDL-Mode is working without additional
configurations.  APDL-Mode is intelligent enough to figure out Ansys
installation dependent paths.  For regular Ansys installations, it
chooses by default the highest installed Ansys version on your system.

   APDL-Mode configures GNU-Emacs to open all files with the suffixes
".mac", ".dat" and ".inp" under apdl-mode.

   The customisations itself are written in ‘Emacs-Lisp’.  The comment
sign in this language is ‘;’ (one semi-colon ‘;’).

-----------------

_.mac_ is the macro suffix of Ansys i.  e.  these macro files can be
called in the Ansys command prompt or APDL like a regular Ansys function
(without the suffix _.mac_).

   APDL-Mode has configured GNU-Emacs to open files with this suffix
under apdl-mode.

   With the following setting

     (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.ans$" . apdl-mode))

   files with the suffix _.ans_ will be opended in Emacs under
APDL-Mode.  Please check the _example.mac_ file in the _doc_ folder.

7.1.3 Boundary conditions
-------------------------

  1. forces

     it is possible to apply time and spatially varying loads either
     tabular or functional.  Example (depending on the coordinate sys.):
     =10*sin(x)
     moment
          scope: geometric selection, named selection, remote point
          contact pair: conta174, targe170 and pilot node similar to
          remote point pilot node is placed at the centre of the geom.
          curvature moment is applied around the reference coordinate
          system.  pinball radius (might) reduce(s) the memory intensive
          range of participating elements
     remote point
          contact pair with reference geometry and pilot node(point)
     remote force
          contacts with pilot node MPC formulation (flexible or rigid)
     pressure
          surf154, sf
     force
          surf154, sfe "line force": surf156, sfe
     bolt pretension
          prets179 (WB: select only ONE face for whole stud!)
     bearing load
          surf154,Elements selected in load direction and pressure load
          applied on projected area (WB: select ALL faces of a
          cylinder!)
     hydrostatic pressure
          surf154, sfgrad and sf

  3. displacements

     remote displacement
          x,y,z, displacments are for the pilot node NOT the entire
          area!
     simply supported
          hinge for beams (rotations are free)
     elastic support
          surf154, r(4)=foundation stiffness, default thickness=1,
          damping possible
     cylindrical support
          rotation with nmodif,node,x,y,z,thxy,...
     compression only support
          rigid surf2surf contacts

       1. Frictionless Support

          Fixing normal displacement with (‘d’), possibly modifying

7.2.1 Idiosyncrasies
--------------------

   • You can only store character variables of 8 characters, strings of
     32 characters and for a maximum of 248 characters you need to
     create a string array!
   • No proper function definitions <- write ‘command’ files (suffix:
     .mac), or call a macro (arbitrary suffix) with ‘*use’, something
     close is to fill a "table" arry, interpolating values and possible
     real indexing A(0.3).
   • you can get table array values with real index values but must use
     integers for assigning them the values, the same goes for *vplot:
     it needs the arry indices in integers and is, moreover, only
     capable to plot the columns and not their line values!
   • *vplot does only plot the columns of arrys, it is not possible to
     specify rows
   • No direct array values to file export in GUI mode <- write command
     file for *vwrite, or use a (lookup) table for this purpose
   • *vwread does not work with C format specifiers in contrast to
     *vwrite
   • Still (v15) no *round* function in sight, but someting like
     nint(max*1e3)/1e3 might do
   • One cannot directly get the variable value, either one must assign
     the variable to another one, or use the ‘*stat’ command
   • Operators > and <: 1 < 2 = 1; 2 < 1 = 1; 2 > 1 = 2 :TODO check
   • Inconsistent naming: /{x,y}range but /axlab,{x,y},
   • Inconsistent comma usage: /com and c*** are working with and
     without a subsequent comma (/com without a comma is eating one
     character)
   • The /contour command does not work on device /show,PNG
   • Deletion of arry parameters without warning only possible with an
     undocumented option: *del,Array,,nopr
   • *cfwrite does parameter substitution without %%: *cfwrite, X_points
     = NoN,*cfwrite, the same as X_points = %NoN%????
   • No direct operation on arrays like A=A*3, takes a detour with
     *voper or *toper
   • Load symbol vectors /pbc,all,,1 in /prep7 are uniform in contrast
     to the more ralistic ones in /solu
   • You can send only a complete block structure to the solver

7.2.5.1 Substitution of Numeric Variables
.........................................

In "string commands" like ‘/com’, where a string follows the command
name one can force the substitution of a parameter name to its value.
Other examples are
     Steel = 1
     /com,Material %Steel% is steel
     !! ATTENTION: in the following situation!
     /com,%Steel% does NOT substitute variable Steel
     /com, %Steel% does substitute variable Steel
     /com,Stuff like %Steel+1% returns 2

It is possible to substitute a command name

     /com, bla = %bla%
     igesin,'test','%iges%'
     /title,Nothing in %particular%
     !! in "string commands" are no code comments possible
     /com,beam3 %YES% ! this is *really not commented out!!!! &
     c*** *beam3 !otto *otto %neither% here !!!!!!! &
     /com, bearm laskf %otto% !%otto% we are here

   • In certain ‘string commands’
   ‘/title’ and ‘/com’ are string commands similar to ‘c***’
     right = 'wrong'
     /title, the value of right is  %right%
     /com, this is %right%: /com does expand parameters as well
   • Unfortunately here is no expansion possible
   neither with ‘c***’ nor with ‘/sys’
     right = 9
     c***,this is %right%: c*** allows no parameter expansion
     /sys,ls "*.mac" %otto% &
     /syp,ls, %otto% !this is not working, no substitution!
     I = 1
     otto = 'file00%I%.eps'
     /syp,ls, otto !this is working as intended

     et,10,solid186
     !! deprecated element types:
     et,Steel,beam3 $ et,Alu,shell91
     !!
   Let’s change the element types to current ones!
     !! Complete the following element fragments to current ones!
     !!
     et,Steel,beam $ et,Alu,shell

   For example select the following elements
     et,Steel,beam188 $ et,Alu,shell28
   and you are getting a diffent element highlighting.

******************************

Copyright (C) 2006 - 2020 H. Dieter Wilhelm, GPL V3

   Please install GNU-Emacs (https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) first,
you should install at least Emacs version 25.1.  (If you are new to this
editor please check the tutorial in its ‘Help’ menu, please really do it
;-)

* Menu:

* Melpa::
* Manual installation::
* Development and source code installation::


File: apdl-mode.info,  Node: Melpa,  Next: Manual installation,  Up: Installation and Development

8.1 Melpa
=========

APDL-Mode is now available on the GNU-Emacs packages archive Melpa
(https://melpa.org/).

   file:https://melpa.org/packages/apdl-mode-badge.svg
(https://melpa.org/#/apdl-mode)
file:https://stable.melpa.org/packages/apdl-mode-badge.svg
(https://stable.melpa.org/#/apdl-mode)

   Please add
     (add-to-list 'package-archives
               '("melpa" . "https://melpa.org/packages/") t)

   to your initialisation file.  Then type: ‘M-x list-packages’, find
‘apdl-mode’, mark it with ‘i’ and install it with ‘x’.

   If you prefer the stable package archive instead of development
versions exchange above package source with
     (add-to-list 'package-archives
     '("melpa-stable" . "https://stable.melpa.org/packages/") t)

8.2 Manual installation
=======================

If you are behind a corporate firewall and you are not able to install
APDL-Mode from Emacs’ package menu, you can download and install
APDL-Mode manually:

   • Download the latest APDL-Mode’s tar package from Melpa
     (https://melpa.org/#/apdl-mode) or - for a released package - from
     the Github
     (https://github.com/dieter-wilhelm/apdl-mode/releases/tag/20.1.0)
     release page.
   • Install the package within Emacs: Please type ‘M-x
     package-install-file <RET>’ and select your downloaded tar file.

   That’s it.

   *Hint:* If you are getting an error message "package.el is not yet
initialized", you are using Emacs’ packaging system for the very first
time.  It is necessary to initialise this machinery once, please type:
‘M-: (package-initialize) <RET>’ (it’s an ’ALT + :’!)  and then apply
‘M-x package-install-file <RET>’ again.

File: apdl-mode.info,  Node: Version 162-1,  Next: Version 1611,  Prev: Version 2010,  Up: News

10.7 Version 162-1
==================

not yet released, targeted for Sep 2015
   • Sending code to the ANYSClassics GUI is now possible as well, not
     only to the restricted interactive solver (currently only on
     GNU-Linux and Unix with C-c C-j, C-c C-u, C-c C-c).
   • Checking available licenses - in a fast and simple way - is now
     also available on Windows platforms with "C-c C-l".
   • Reorganised and simplified the installation and configuration.
     Made the initialisation defaults more intelligent, i.  e.
     searching for installation paths with environment variables, etc.
   • New customisation variable ‘ansys-parameter-help-duration’ for
     adjusting the display duration of the
     ‘ansys-show-command-parameters’ overlay.
   • Reorganised and improved the menu items, separated general Ansys
     tasks from APDL coding with two main menu Entries: A-Mode and
     Ansys.
   • New functions: Reading the original APDL guide and Ansys-Mode’s
     documentation in a Browser, opening an empty buffer in Ansys-Mode,
     ansys-start-launcher, ansys-start-classics, ...
   • The command ‘C-c C-j’ does now recognise blocks (APDL loops and
     control structures), which is to say it copies or sends complete
     logical blocks to the interpreter instead of only the current code
     line.
   • Changed Ansys-Mode’s versioning scheme from 16.2.1 to 162-1


File: apdl-mode.info,  Node: Version 1611,  Next: Version 1501,  Prev: Version 162-1,  Up: News

10.8 Version 16.1.1
===================

July 2015
   • The command ‘ansys-show-command-parameters’ (M-?)  does
     additionally count the number of parameters and visualise at which
     parameter position the cursor currently is.  This tool-tip can now
     be switched off with a prefix argument of zero.
   • The command ‘ansys-send-to-ansys-and-proceed’ (C-c C-j) is now
     interactive, i.  e.  after invoking this command with its
     key-sequence "C-c C-j" it can be repeated by typing just the final
     character "j" (or "C-j").
   • The command ‘ansys-send-to-ansys’ (C-c C-c) grabs now the current
     paragraph, when there is no region marked.  And the cursor doesn’t
     skip to the next code line without a prefix argument "C-u".
   • The output buffer *Ansys* of the interpreter commands might now
     reside on a another Emacs frame.
   • switched on truncation of lines for Ansys-Mode buffers, e.  g.  it
     is easier to read when there are many parameters in the
     ansys-show-parameter-help.
   • Extended the APDL material library which includes now creep and
     multi-linear plasticity data in matlib/ as well.
   • Is packaged with the current stable version Emacs-24.5 and updated
     for Ansys 16.  Besides the Windows version there is also now a
     source package available for compiling Emacs-24.5 together with
     Ansys-Mode.
   • Renamed README, NEWS and TODO to *.org, fontification.mac to
     example.mac.  Included an example.dat and example.anf


File: apdl-mode.info,  Node: Version 1501,  Next: Version 1452,  Prev: Version 1611,  Up: News

10.9 Version 15.0.1
===================

Aug 2014
   • Added an example of an Ansys material library
   • C-c C-c (ansys-send-to-ansys) doesn’t skip to the next code line
     any longer but remains in the code line.  The former behaviour
     borrows the new function C-c C-j (ansys-send-to-ansys-and-proceed),
     executing and then skipping to the next code.
   • Improved the ‘ansys-show-blabla...
   • Highlighted now the parametric function CXABS(), which was already
     introduced in V14.
   • Updated the help, completion and highlighting functionality to V15
     And as usual: Corrected some bugs, typos and extended the
     templates, e.  g.  partial solutions with psolve for mass
     calculations.


File: apdl-mode.info,  Node: Version 1452,  Next: Version 1451,  Prev: Version 1501,  Up: News

10.10 Version 14.5.2
====================

Mar 2013
   • The unwieldy and usually uninteresting pure number blocks (the
     nblock, eblocks and cmblocks) in files with the suffix .dat are now
     hidden by default.  WorkBench creates these blocks in input files
     for the solver.  You can, off course, unhide these blocks and
     inspect them as well.

     Functions: ‘ansys-hide-number-blocks’, ‘ansys-show-number-blocks’,
     ‘ansys-hide-region’

     Customising variables: ‘ansys-hide-region-before-string’,
     ‘ansys-hide-region-after-string’ and
     ‘ansys-hide-region-propertize-markers’

   • Added a way for showing the current value and status of a user
     variable at point, overcoming the drawback of C-c C-v
     ‘ansys-display-variables’ that it is showing only the variable
     definitions and definitions coming from external files are not
     shown.  You can activate this functionality (Linux only) with a
     prefix argument: C-u C-c C-v.
   • Fixed the completion and highlighting of command keywords and their
     help entries, in the previous release were unfortunately many
     keywords missing or entries incomplete.
   • As always: Enhancements and corrections for the APDL templates,
     added a beam simulation template


File: apdl-mode.info,  Node: Version 1451,  Next: Version 1401,  Prev: Version 1452,  Up: News

10.11 Version 14.5.1
====================

Sep 2012
   • Added a function (C-c C-b or "M-x ansys-browse-ansys-help") showing
     the detailed Ansys help in your web-browser for an APDL command or
     element name (also the element number is sufficient) around the
     cursor (or if that fails at the line beginning).

     Are you also tired of the Ansys help browser?  For example try
     searching for the ‘F’ APDL command, it is impossible!  (update
     2014: This has improved with the new help viewer in V15.)  You have
     to pick it up from the alphabetical command list.  Likewise when
     you are searching for an incomplete keyword, no hint, no
     completion, nothing!  Finding and browsing relevant APDL
     documentation is still cumbersome and too slow.

     As a highlight of this release you can now read immediately the
     detailed Ansys help in your web browser for *all* APDL command AND
     element names around the cursor (or for the first command in the
     current line if that fails to be valid keyword).  You may input
     your search string also interactively, including its completion to
     Ansys help keywords and of certain help categories, like ‘Release
     Notes’ and such.  This is an ideal complement to Ansys-Mode’s
     in-built ‘command syntax help’.

   • The function ‘ansys-start-ansys’ is now available under Windows as
     well and starts the APDL product launcher under this platform.
   • When calling ‘ansys-browse-ansys-help’ and
     ‘ansys-show-command-parameters’ (M-?  - the in-built ‘command
     syntax help’) with a prefix argument for interactively entering a
     command name, the name is now completable.  And in the
     non-interactive mode both functions working also for APDL commands
     which are commented out as well (only for the first command in case
     of ‘ansys-show-command-parameters’).
   • Also the input of ‘ansys-query-ansys-command’ (C-c C-q) is now
     completable to all current Ansys commands and with an optional
     prefix argument the current code line is copied as the initial
     input.
   • Improved the introductory and the in-depth tutorial and extended
     the documentation with an APDL and syntax highlighting reference in
     HTML and PDF. (To some degree syntax highlighted in the PDF version
     as well)
   • Values of the ‘_RETURN’ variable are now documented in the function
     ‘ansys-skeleton-information’
   • ‘ansys-next-code-line’ and ‘ansys-previous-code-line’ (M-n, M-p)
     are now skipping over node and elements blocks, which are only pure
     number blocks.  They are now alternatives to
     ‘ansys-number-block-start’ C-c { and C-c } respectively
   • Removed bug in customisation system and dropped 32 bit Ansys
     support in line with the Ansys OS
     [<https://www.ansys.com/Support/Platform+Support> strategy] for
     2013.
   • Described a poor man’s round() workaround in
     ansys-template-function under the nint() entry

10.12 Version 14.0.1
====================

June 2012
   • Enhanced the documentation, included is now an introductory
     tutorial ‘ansys-mode_tutorial.pdf’ and a hands-on tutorial
     ‘APDL_tutorial.pdf’
   • Added a timer for getting rid of the parameter help overlays after
     some time interval (1 min) without reusing the parameter help
   • Added a (customisable) variable ‘ansys-no-of-processors’ and
     function with the same name for specifying the number of processors
     for an Ansys multiprocessor run
   • Activated outline-minor-mode and auto-insertion (in default_el)
   • Extended mode commands, templates and removed typos mainly in
     ansys-template.el.  For example added all *get functions in the
     ansys-skeleton-function template
   • Added a custom variable the corresponding function
     ansys-ansysli-servers for specifying the ansys interconnect license
     servers
   • Added a new shortcut and menu entry isometric view
   • Applied sensible defaults to ansys-lmutil-program, ansys-program
     and ansys-help-program, for most needs it should now be enough just
     to set the used ansys version (ansys-current-ansys-version, if it
     is not 140, see the example configuration file default_el) and
     maybe additionally the installation directory
     (ansys-install-directory).

10.13 Version 13.0.1
====================

March 2011
   • Added support for aligning whole sections of Ansys variable
     definitions, both in the Ansys menu and as a keyboard shortcut ’C-c
     C-a’
   • Enhanced ansys-display-skeleton with an optional argument for
     inserting the respective skeleton in the APDL buffer.
   • Enhanced some "interactive" code templates with lists for
     completing the input and sensible defaults
   • Refined some abbreviation definitions and focused the display of
     abbreviations to the mode specific ones
   • Fixed insert pair functions, like ’C-c %’
   • Changed keyboard shortcut for calling the Ansys help to ’C-c C-h’
   • Updated keyword list, deprecated elements, undocumented commands,
     etc.  to release 13.0 of Ansys, as usual.

10.14 Version 12.0.1
====================

Dec 2010
   • Some new graphics commands like ansys-zoom-in, -zoom-out,
     -move-left, -right, -up, -down, etc.
   • The lisp code had to be split up for better maintenance, the code
     files for are now provided in an archive together with their
     compiled state for speed reasons.
   • Reworked the highlighting mainly for the sake of speed.  There are
     now highlighting levels to choose from, offering e.  g.
     highlighting of deprecated element types in a warning-face,
     deprecated Ansys * comments and so on
   • Updated and improved the readability of the mode’s help and the
     README file
   • The output from the LMUtil license status tool (C-c C-l) is now
     filtered on UNIX to be more concise.
   • The ‘ansys-send-to-ansys’ (C-c C-c) and the
     ansys-copy-or-send-above (C-c C-u) commands are now generalised so
     that they are also doing some useful stuff without a running Ansys
     interpreter process (they copy in that case the cursor line/the
     chosen region and copy from the file beginning to the cursor line,
     respectively, to the clipboard).  Given a prefix argument to these
     commands, the cursor won’t move to the next code line.
   • The completion of Ansys keywords is reworked and has improved.
     Ansys symbols are now completed in 3 ways: Up-case, down-case and
     capitalise.
   • New: Added tool-tips to all Ansys menu entries.  Activated or
     deactivated menu entries according to the context
   • Ansys mode tries to gather information from the OS environment when
     the variable ‘ansys-license-file’ is not set by the user and uses
     now Ansys standard names as default values for some more variables.
   • The variables in the variable summary are now sorted according to
     their first occurrence and not any longer in "definition types".
     Now component names are included with the variable highlighting.
   • Added menu entry for reloading Ansys Mode for the case when certain
     customisation options in the code files itself are changed and
     require a code reloading to take effect.
   • Ansys mode changes some Emacs default behaviour to smooth the
     transition from other editors

10.15 Version 11.0.2
====================

Nov 2009
   • Enabled the preview of code templates or fragments (called
     skeletons in this mode, please inspect ‘ansys-display-skeleton’).
   • Removed "buffer has no process" bug when killing an ansys-mode
     buffer.
   • Submitting interactively Ansys commands (via mini-buffer query, not
     only as written in a macro file) to the solver process,
     ansys-query-ansys-command (C-c C-q).


File: apdl-mode.info,  Node: ansys-modeel 1101,  Prev: Version 1102,  Up: News

10.16 ansys-mode.el 11.0.1
==========================

2009 in comparison to ansys-mod.el,
   • New: Provides Ansys command parameter- and syntax help.
   • New: Offers Ansys process management: Acquiring license server
     information in a buffer Starting and stopping asynchronously Ansys
     runs.  Sending code lines to running Ansys process (sort of code
     debugging facility) and getting the output into a buffer.
   • New: Experimental highlighting of user defined variables.
     Redefinition and clearing of variables is not yet taken into
     account.
   • New: Emacs customisation facility is available for the new Ansys
     mode group.
   • New: Emacs outline-minor-mode is readily available in conjunction
     with this mode.
   • Completions of Ansys commands are now case-sensitive, with
     additional completion of function and element names.
   • Previously defined skeletons are fully functional now, new ones are
     added and enabled with the abbreviation and auto-load facilities of
     Emacs 22.
   • Ansys’ interpreter’s disregard of any capitalisation is now fully
     taken into account in the highlighting.
   • The apostrophe "’" is now assigned as the Ansys string and the
     value of character parameters delimiter and not wrongly """; the
     strings are highlighted accordingly.
   • The dollar sign "$" is now emphasised as the Ansys condensed input
     character (multiple Ansys commands in one line).
   • The colon ":" is now emphasised as the Ansys colon do loop
     character ("(x:y:z)" means from x to y, in z steps, z is equal to
     one as default).  For example: "n,(1:6),(2:18:2)" runs 6 loops.
     Colon loops are working also with real values: k,,(2.5:3:0.1) and
     with array parameters: k,,A(1:100), but the latter is an
     undocumented feature.  Since ansys 11.0 the colon looping is also
     working with *GET functions (example: A(1:5)=NX(1:5))).  A ":"
     indicates also a beginning of a label for the *GO and *IF command.
   • "%" is now distinguished as the Ansys parameter substitution and
     format specifier character.
   • The ampersand "&" is now correctly highlighted as the only
     available Ansys continuation character applicable to the format
     commands (*MSG, *MWRITE, *VREAD and *VWRITE) command and the
     subsequent format strings of the command are highlighted.
   • New: " *" (<SPC> before ‘*’) is indicated as an (Ansys deprecated)
     comment sign e.  g.: %% a = 3 **4 %% results in "a" having the
     value 3, whereas %% a = 3**4 %% sets "a" to 81!
   • New: A line beginning with a comma is indented to the length of the
     last non slash or asterisk command as a reminder that the Ansys
     solver interprets this as a space holder for the last command
     keyword (the Ansys default command concept).
   • Extended documentation, code cleaning and simplification of
     commands (e.g.  comment handling) with the application of standard
     Emacs 22 facilities among other things.

12.6.4 Deficiencies:
--------------------

Highlighting
     Experimental user variable highlighting does not take into account:
        • clearing of variables and
        • usage of variables before their definitions (uninitialised
          variables)
        • the variable fontification might clash with Ansys specifiers
        • string substitution of %variables% in strings does not
          highlight them in the proper variable face
Highlighting
     A label :LABEL may appear behind the /input command and is not
     highlighted as label
Highlighting
     An apostrophy clashes with the Ansys "char" specifier Keybinding:
     M-Tab is captured under Windows and some GNU-Linux desktops
     Workaround: Press instead of M-Tab (ALT + TAB) the ESC key and then
     the Tab key (ESC, TAB) or apply the command from the menu bar
Keybinding
     M-j: When there is already a ‘&’ in a format command (like *msg,
     *vwrite, *mwrite) ansys-indent-format-line inserts a redundant one
Keybinding
     C-c C-j jjj not working with Emacs version < Emacs-24
Completion
     Of parametric function parentheses completes redundant closing
     parentheses
Completion
     A mouse selection from the *Ansys-completion* buffer is only
     inserted upcased.
Completion
     Ansys command ’C***’ will not be completed
Skeleton
     Mouse selection of -structural-template does not work (because of
     stipulated user text input from this skeleton)
Navigation
     C-c { does not skip an overlay in a number-block (M-{ does it
     though))

12.6.8.1 Parameter help and documentation
.........................................

   • Enable a mouse button to unhide hidden regions, enable an
     interactive way to unhide regions, when in the region: Return opens
     hidden region, ...
   • dynamic completion and help of parameter options, depending on the
     contex like the one in bash
   • makeinfo documentation with org-mode ox exporter
   • make completion of templates with <mouse 1> button additionally to
     <mouse 2> as in -complete-symbol.
   • create a function showing deprecated elements and their
     replacement.  Inspirations from eldoc-mode, show replacements of
     deprecated elements?
   • create a reference card
   • show list of license products and their license feature names or
     translate it in the license status from the licensing guide
     (product variable table)
   • C-c C-v show (optionally) only variables defined up to current
     cursor line.  Make the line number display in
     ‘ansys-display-variables’ (hyper-)links to the corresponding code
     line in the respective APDL file.  (See ‘occur’ function.)  Or use
     the imenu mechanism for this and display the variables in the
     speedbar.  Count the number of user variables when displaying them
   • refcard, etc; Emacs help guidelines GNU programming guideline: More
     requires?,
   • display alternatives to/swap deprecated element types
   • M-?  Help: parametric functions are not explained with the help
     command
   • M-?  Help: if there are ignored characters behind the keyword, the
     keyword is not found
   • M-?  the command help does not work when there are solver ignored
     characters behind the unique command name, example: *VWROOOOM.
   • M-?: following a variable allocation with ‘=’
   • M-?: In the last empty line displays overlay below command instead
     above
   • Provide Ansys command completion and command-help in comint buffer
   • Include all inquiry functions (see UPF documentation)
   • Include the _RETURN value of the solid modelling commands into
     their help strings of parameter help.


File: apdl-mode.info,  Node: Ansys process and interpreter buffer,  Next: Skeletons outline and abbrevs,  Prev: Parameter help and documentation,  Up: Ideas for further versions

12.6.8.2 Ansys process and interpreter buffer
.............................................

example: gnuplot-mode
   • call to start the Ansys solution results tracker for .nlh (xml see
     <file.nlh>, contact forces) and convergence .gst (binary?, coded?
     <file.gst>)
   • implement something like <nlhist.sh> for .cnd files (xml see
     <file.cnd>) or use the new libxml parser ;-)
   • make display-buffer "*Ansys*" optional when sending commands to the
     Ansys process
   • use Ansys *env variables* like AWP_ROOT140 for checking
     installation directories
   • check also the license status for hpc licenses if -no-of-processors
     is greater then 3
   • implement ANSWAIT variable
   • autoloading of: -license-file, -license-program functions
   • dbus support of workbench or integrating emacs in workbench?
   • insert skeleton with C-c C-s i, send line C-c C-c ccc
   • warn when C-c C-c tries to send a block command (complete to full
     block?)
   • take care when region isn’t complete in -send-to-ansys (send whole
     line)
   • C-c C-c skips empty lines and comments this is not always desirable
     -> make this optional -> filter process input?
   • C-c C-q, C-c C-u and C-c C-c sequences are not shown (and stored)
     in the comint buffer
   • make filter of -license-status optional
   • optimise -start-run with query of y (start immediately),n (exit),e
     (change params),C-h (help)
   • Splice any input line behind the BEGIN: symbol in the *Ansys*
     buffer
   • Enable one solver run for every Ansys macro buffer
   • indicate with activation/inactivation of menu items that an
     asynchronous job is already running or not.
   • show/mark sent lines in apdl file C-c C-u, C-c C-c,
        • with fringes
        • with background
        • maximum line
        • reset highlighting, when?
   • provide Ansys ‘y’ request and carriage return?  superflouous?  a
     single ‘y’ does the trick
   • Killing a buffer with a running process now asks a confirmation.
     You can remove this query in two ways: either removing
     ‘process-kill-buffer-query-function’ from
     ‘kill-buffer-query-functions’ or setting the appropriate process
     flag with ‘set-process-query-on-exit-flag’.
        • finding an Ansys /filnam command in current macro file and
          suggesting this as current job-name optionally kill old job
          when called again with working run warn and optionally remove
          the ansys lock file before starting a run
        • search in -job for /filn arguments as default job name like in
          -display-error-file


File: apdl-mode.info,  Node: Skeletons outline and abbrevs,  Next: Miscellaneous 1,  Prev: Ansys process and interpreter buffer,  Up: Ideas for further versions

12.6.8.3 Skeletons, outline and abbrevs
.......................................

   • show a preview buffer with the outline headlines
   • -skeleton-select is a bit thin, not yet finished?
   • add a preview mode, with its own keymap for faster editing and
     copying, like dired
   • enhance abbrev definitions for *create, *dowhile logics:
   • use the Ansys sample input listing for template-examples
   • additional dialog boxes with: /ui,anno,ksel...,wpse,help,query,copy
   • make outline string in skeletons configurable
   • spider beams, _bolt.mac, screw.mac, Mohr-Coulomb criterion
   • rework concept with respect to the Ansys menu structure sort
     skeletons in menu.  Concept: 1.)  Ansys Workflow 2.)  specialised
     macro library
   • Make skeleton-header properly working (info "(autotype)")
   • Optimise templates: completing-read, read-from-minibuffer
   • abbrev ‘d does not indent properly in another block level
   • Implement choice when completing *IF commands (*ELSEIF or *ENDIF
     ?THEN?).
   • Warn when including skeleton in read only file.
   • skeleton for numbering ansys-skeleton-numbering-controls
     (skeleton-insert docu)
   • suggestions with auto-completion of
     kp,line,area,volu,node,elem,tabn,sval
   • negation, what negation?  TODO:
   • skeleton for skipping code *if,then *else*endif if selection: wrap
     around and indenting *go/*if label is not fontified at the command
     line (restriction of 7 characters with out the colon.)  must
     *go:label be unambiguous?

   • Are characters behind unique commands shorter than 4 characters
     possible?  No /sol(u) sufficient?  Yes condensed input line ($)
     behind commands without arguments possible?  Yes have a look in
     -variable-defining-commands!  Warn when - unintentionally -
     arguments are used for Ansys commands which do not allow arguments.

      Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
      of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

     0. PREAMBLE

     The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
     functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to
     assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
     with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.
     Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way
     to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible
     for modifications made by others.

     This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
     works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It
     complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
     license designed for free software.

     We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
     software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
     program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
     software does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals;
     it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
     whether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License
     principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.


     1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

     This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that
     contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be
     distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice grants a
     world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that
     work under the conditions stated herein.  The "Document", below,
     refers to any such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a
     licensee, and is addressed as "you".  You accept the license if you
     copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission
     under copyright law.

     A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
     Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
     modifications and/or translated into another language.

     A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of
     the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
     publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
     subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall
     directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document is in
     part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain
     any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical
     connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
     commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
     them.

     The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
     are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
     that says that the Document is released under this License.  If a
     section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not
     allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may contain zero
     Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify any Invariant
     Sections then there are none.

     The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed,
     as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
     the Document is released under this License.  A Front-Cover Text may
     be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.

     A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
     represented in a format whose specification is available to the
     general public, that is suitable for revising the document
     straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
     pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
     drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
     for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
     to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
     format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart
     or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.
     An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount
     of text.  A copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

     Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
     ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML
     or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple
     HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.  Examples of
     transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.  Opaque formats
     include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by
     proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or
     processing tools are not generally available, and the
     machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word
     processors for output purposes only.

     The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
     plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
     this License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in
     formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title Page" means
     the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,
     preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

     The "publisher" means any person or entity that distributes copies of
     the Document to the public.

     A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document whose
     title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following
     text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ stands for a
     specific section name mentioned below, such as "Acknowledgements",
     "Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".)  To "Preserve the Title"
     of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a
     section "Entitled XYZ" according to this definition.

     The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which
     states that this License applies to the Document.  These Warranty
     Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this
     License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
     implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has
     no effect on the meaning of this License.

     2. VERBATIM COPYING

     You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
     commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
     copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
     to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no
     other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use
     technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
     copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept
     compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough
     number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.

     You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
     you may publicly display copies.


     3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

     If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have
     printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the
     Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the
     copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
     Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
     the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify
     you as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present
     the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
     visible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition.
     Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve
     the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated
     as verbatim copying in other respects.

     If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
     legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
     reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
     pages.

     If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
     more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
     copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
     a computer-network location from which the general network-using
     public has access to download using public-standard network protocols
     a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material.
     If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps,
     when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure
     that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
     location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an
     Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that
     edition to the public.

     It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
     Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to
     give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the
     Document.


     4. MODIFICATIONS

     You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
     the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
     the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
     Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
     and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
     of it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:

     A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
        from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
        (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
        of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version
        if the original publisher of that version gives permission.
     B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
        responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
        Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the
        Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five),
        unless they release you from this requirement.
     C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
        Modified Version, as the publisher.
     D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.
     E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
        adjacent to the other copyright notices.
     F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
        giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
        terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.
     G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
        and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.
     H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.
     I. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title, and add
        to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
        publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If
        there is no section Entitled "History" in the Document, create one
        stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
        given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
        Version as stated in the previous sentence.
     J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
        public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
        the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
        it was based on.  These may be placed in the "History" section.
        You may omit a network location for a work that was published at
        least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
        publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.
     K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
        Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all
        the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements
        and/or dedications given therein.
     L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
        unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
        or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.
     M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
        may not be included in the Modified Version.
     N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled "Endorsements"
        or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.
     O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

     If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
     appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
     copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
     of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the
     list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice.
     These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.

     You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
     nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
     parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
     been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
     standard.

     You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
     passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
     of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of
     Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
     through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already
     includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
     by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
     you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
     permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.

     The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
     give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
     imply endorsement of any Modified Version.


     5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
     License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
     versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
     Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
     list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
     license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.

     The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
     multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
     copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
     different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
     adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
     author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.
     Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
     Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.

     In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled "History"
     in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled
     "History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled "Acknowledgements",
     and any sections Entitled "Dedications".  You must delete all sections
     Entitled "Endorsements".


     6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
     documents released under this License, and replace the individual
     copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
     that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the rules
     of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all
     other respects.

     You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
     distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a
     copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this
     License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that
     document.


     7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
     and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
     distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the copyright
     resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights
     of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit.
     When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not
     apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves
     derivative works of the Document.

     If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
     copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of
     the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on
     covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
     electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form.
     Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole
     aggregate.


     8. TRANSLATION

     Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
     distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.
     Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
     permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
     translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
     original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
     translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
     Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include
     the original English version of this License and the original versions
     of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a disagreement between
     the translation and the original version of this License or a notice
     or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.

     If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
     "Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to Preserve
     its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual
     title.


     9. TERMINATION

     You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
     except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
     otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void, and
     will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

     However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license
     from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally,
     unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally
     terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder
     fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to
     60 days after the cessation.

     Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
     reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
     violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
     received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
     copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
     your receipt of the notice.

     Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
     licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
     this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
     reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the same material does
     not give you any rights to use it.


     10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the
     GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new versions
     will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in
     detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
     https://www.gnu.org/licenses/.

     Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.
     If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
     License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of
     following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
     of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
     Free Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version
     number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
     as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Document
     specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of this
     License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a
     version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the
     Document.

     11. RELICENSING

     "Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site" (or "MMC Site") means any
     World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
     provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.  A
     public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.  A
     "Massive Multiauthor Collaboration" (or "MMC") contained in the site
     means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC site.

     "CC-BY-SA" means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0
     license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit
     corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,
     California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license
     published by that same organization.

     "Incorporate" means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or in
     part, as part of another Document.

     An MMC is "eligible for relicensing" if it is licensed under this
     License, and if all works that were first published under this License
     somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently incorporated in whole or
     in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover texts or invariant sections, and
     (2) were thus incorporated prior to November 1, 2008.

     The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the site
     under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1, 2009,
     provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.


     ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents

     To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
     the License in the document and put the following copyright and
     license notices just after the title page:

         Copyright (c)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
         Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
         under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3
         or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
         with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts.
         A copy of the license is included in the section entitled "GNU
         Free Documentation License".

     If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts,
     replace the "with...Texts." line with this:

         with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the
         Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.

     If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
     combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
     situation.

     If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
     recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
     free software license, such as the GNU General Public License,
     to permit their use in free software.
