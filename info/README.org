* Introduction
  #+include:../info/introduction.org

  [[file:doc/connect_command_snippet_to_file.png]]

* Some Highlights
** In-built APDL command help with argument counter
   Especially for commands with a large number of arguments it is
   cumbersome to count the arguments, *C-?* facilitates this for you
   and visualises dynamically at which parameter position your cursor
   currently is.

   [[file:doc/parameter_help2.png]]

** Pin-pointing the relevant Ansys documentation
   You can trigger (*C-c C-b*) the relevant Ansys manual entry
   directly from your APDL-Mode session without the detour of
   searching in the Ansys online help (default since V19).  This works
   not only for APDL commands but also element names and other manual
   topics. (To that end you must have started / registered the Ansys
   online help once from an Ansys product.  But I recommend installing
   the Ansys documentation locally, loading is much faster.)

   The image below is showing a manual entry in GNU-Emacs' EWW
   browser. You are able to consult the manual side-by-side with your
   APDL code.

** Command Object Templates and Code Highlighting Example
   You are learning and also coding APDL best by example!  APDL-Mode
   provides coding examples, here called templates, for the most often
   used subjects.  Moreover you are able to compile your own WorkBench
   / Discovery AIM Command templates and have them all immediately
   available in APDL-Mode for inspection and inclusion.

   APDL-Mode is helping you with code colourisation to distinguish
   valid commands, user variables, element names, comments, APDL
   functions and further subjects.

   Below image shows GNU-Emacs with a ripped off APDL-Mode menu, the
   APDL variable buffer, the APDL file itself and an APDL template
   preview.

** Code outlining for inspecting WorkBench solver (.dat) files
   APDL-Mode hides the normally uninteresting but usually very large
   number blocks.

* Installation
  #+include: ./INSTALLATION.org

* First Steps
  #+include: ./first_steps.org
* Configuration and Customisation
  Most functionality is working without additional configurations.
  APDL-Mode is intelligent enough to figure out Ansys installation
  dependent paths.  For regular Ansys installations, it chooses by
  default the highest installed Ansys version on your system.

  APDL-Mode configures GNU-Emacs to open all files with the suffixes
  ".mac", ".dat" and ".inp" under apdl-mode.

  Please read the [[file:info/apdl-config.org][apdl-config]] documentation for further options or
  open the accompanying configuration [[file:info/apdl-config.el][example-file]].
