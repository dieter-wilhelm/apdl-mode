* Introduction
  #+include:../info/introduction.org

  [[file:doc/connect_command_snippet_to_file.png]]

* Some Highlights
** In-built APDL command help with argument counter
   Especially for commands with a large number of arguments it is
   cumbersome to count the arguments, *M-?* facilitates this for you
   and visualises dynamically at which parameter position your cursor
   currently is.

   [[file:doc/parameter_help2.png]]

** Pin-pointing the relevant Ansys documentation
   You can browse (with *C-c C-b* on a code line) the relevant Ansys
   manual entry directly without the detour of searching in the Ansys
   online help.  This works not only for all APDL commands but also
   for element names and more general manual topics!

   Since Ansys v191 the online help is the default.  APDL-Mode is
   using your default browser but to be able to access the online help
   you must register or you must start the online help once from any
   licensed Ansys product.  I recommend installing the local Ansys
   documentation, access time is much shorter.  You can download the
   "help installer" from their [[https://support.ansys.com/Home/HomePage][Customer Portal]].

   The image below is showing a manual entry in GNU-Emacs' EWW
   browser.  You are able to consult the manuals side-by-side your
   APDL code.

   Please check the [[file:info/apdl-config.org][APDL-Mode configuration]] documentation on how to
   configure EWW as default browser or inspect the project's
   [[file:info/apdl-config.el][configuration example]].

** Command Object Templates and Code Highlighting Example
   You are learning and also coding APDL best by example!  APDL-Mode
   provides coding examples, here called templates, for the most often
   used subjects.  Moreover you are able to compile your own WorkBench
   / Discovery AIM Command templates and have them all immediately
   available in APDL-Mode for inspection and inclusion.

   APDL-Mode is helping you with code colourisation to distinguish
   valid commands, user variables, element names, comments, APDL
   functions and further subjects.

   Below image shows GNU-Emacs with a ripped off APDL-Mode menu, the
   APDL variable buffer, the APDL file itself and an APDL template
   preview.

** Code outlining for inspecting WorkBench solver (.dat) files
   APDL-Mode hides the normally uninteresting but usually very large
   number blocks.

* Installation
  #+include: ./INSTALLATION.org

* First Step
  #+include: ./first_steps.org
* Configuration and Customisation
  Most functionality is working without additional configurations.
  APDL-Mode is intelligent enough to figure out Ansys installation
  dependent paths.  For regular Ansys installations, it chooses by
  default the highest installed Ansys version on your system.

  APDL-Mode configures GNU-Emacs to open all files with the suffixes
  ".mac", ".dat" and ".inp" under apdl-mode.

  Please read the [[file:info/apdl-config.org][apdl-config]] documentation for further options or
  open the accompanying configuration [[file:apdl-config.el][example-file]].
