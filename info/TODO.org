# title problematic for Info
# #+title: The TODO file of APDL-Mode

* V 21.1
  - Ansys changed since 21 the location of the lmutil tool
* V 20.7.0
** Bug
   - jit-lock: Error during redisplay: (jit-lock-function 1) signaled
     (wrong-type-argument stringp nil), example.dat
   - Fontification problems with backslashes in strings from .dat
     files from windows \' apdl-mode is then looking for the next `''
     :-/
** Issue
   - Rework menu: new entry for number blocks in .dat files
     (nblocks,eblocks,cmblocks)
     - C-c C-a doesn't align the code comments when there are variable
       and no numbers!
   - C-c C-a not working without region at beginning of buffer, only.
     Usually we have some header, don't we?
   - Linux: C-c C-o -> *APDL Classics* Buffer when process running
   - Reload apdl-mode isn't working
   - For a 80 MB .dat file it takes 2 min to start apdl-mode, skipping
     fontification for huge files? No but searching for user variables!
** Wish
  - check apdl-font-lock-keywords-3
  - asynchronous licensing status
  - DONE in dev: Look into derived branch: prog-modes
* TODO Version 20.6.0
  - Branch 20.6.0 [2021-10-01 Fr]
  - Feature freeze: Only bugs or template changes
** Todos, bugs
   - M-? get- and parameter-functions are completed but there's no
      parameter help - see: apdl-dynamic-prompt
   - *mwrite
     *cfclos or any asterisk command
     M-? shows help for *mwrite, when cursor behind *cfclos and in the
     last line without \n
   - APDL reference is incomplete
   - Tutorial pictures are often outdated (ansys -> apdl)
   - HTML docu is bad
   - Templates: Add intro help to the -wb-template system, complete
     usage.org
     - Code Templates, apdl-wb-custom-template-directory
     - Export of WB command objects to file on disc in the manual
** Issues
   - Do we really need to specify the license interconnect server?
   - M-? parameter counter is not working for commands where functions
      with multiple arguments are in the argument list!
     f,node(x,y,z),,,
   - Some keybindings (6+1) for fkmpqr,d: -f -fit, -m -start-ansys, -r
     -replot, -q -query-apdl-command, -k -kill-anys, -p
     -start-pzr-box: are for interactive server use, -d -do <-
     abbrevs!?
   - Discovery Aim is obsolete?
   - c*** isn't completed
   - Cygwin terminal initialisation not working, /cydrive/c:?
     - setting -ansys-installation-path should do
       - ugly ^M line endings -license-status
       - w32-shell-execute not working for -start-help-program
   - Cygwin emacs-w32 ugly ^M line endings for C-c C-l
** Checks
   - Changed file size without warning to 30 MB, Emacs-28 is using <=
     10 MB, large-file-warning-threshold
   - EWW bug: not working with remote ssh -help-path
     (debbugs-gnu-bugs 40425)
** Wishes
   - A better Info index
   - Mouse completion is working with *middle* mouse button (mouse-2)
     but only on the second LMB or, in the case of C-c C-s, not at
     all.
   - Templates, WB-templates, more of them
   - Presentation(s) and EN Wiki, youtube?
   - Help system and docu, rather complete, except online docu
*** Docu
    Outdated menus in images : A-M-introductory_tutorial.org

    Rework the messy documentation system of files and applications
    1) INFO -> info/apdl-mode.org <- flat file
    2) MD for github -> info/README.org <- uses folder structure
    3) Melpa packaging -> apdl-mode

    - Things like C-c C-jjj (more?) are not documented in manual!
    - more C-c C-b subjects?

    - Create English Wiki for APDL
    - Link to Ansys Youtube channel in menu? (It's already in Ansys
      resources!)
    - The Command (APDL) objects coding system seems to be
      mule-utf-8-dos aka cp65001-dos, document this
    - Customise system (explain `M-x customize-set-value' as long as
      (debbugs-gnu-bugs 25678) is not solved)?

   Info documentation:
      - don't line break ref{references}!

     - work on the Info index #+cindex:
     - #+include: #+title adds to info title!
     - inline @@texinfo: @@
     - #+texinfo: @inforef{node,name,file} links to Emacs info pages,
       done, make contex SELF SUSTAINED!! Is adding "See" in the text!
       ;-)
     - Attention colon ":" in headline gives a texinfo reference!
     - C-u C-h i: info file :-)
     - package with file "dir"
     - only up to 3 *** levels! configurable?
     - info doesn't have clickable links to function, customisation
       buffers, yet, hmm urls, internal links? <- inform package
     - image directory in .info file is not existing in Melpa! Do we
       need images in the manual? No

     Presentations

     - in-depth presentation, tutorial?
     - APDL reference => just Info?

     MD
     - #+caption: not working!
     - #+title: not working!
*** templates
   - wb templates in README.org, clear, will grow with usage
     - contact pressure evaluation, press-fit
     - harmonic, acceleration
     - imbalance load
     - rotordynamics
     - temperature dependent load
    - Intelligent template selector with keywords in the line of helm
      or ivy?
    - What is the advantage of ARG1-9? => parameter system, should I
      include ARG[1-9] optionally?
*** misc
    1) make *License* buffers read-only
    2) Add a quit key for variable buffers
    3) derive A-M from prog-modes => branch derived
    4) Travis CI continuous integration!
    5) https://github.com/marketplace/coveralls
    6) Start optionally runbWB2 --aim, Discovery AIM

** Done
   - Make text around #+texinfo: lines self sustained!
   - -mode-version working with autoload cookie: works
   - include -mode-version in autoload list
** Push and Release Proceedures

** Bugs
   - Hmm, it's gone?  C-c C-s first time visit: User variables
     file-name-extension: Wrong type argument: stringp, nilError
     during redisplay: (jit-lock-function 1) signaled

     variable block
   - remove spurious defcustoms which are calculated, or leave them as
     last resort?

     buffer was/is an unavailable network drive .
   - add bbdb files to emacs packages
   - -help-program-parameters obsolete
   - MinGWin: FindWindowFindWindow(CLASSNAME, WINDOWNAME)

         vbody -- Define a B-rep solid.
     - add Hlp_G_OPE6_NeutralFile.html (aux15 utility functions)

       ASURF, VBODY. (functions in ANF files) from the operations
       guide `ans_ope.pdf'
     - some functions in -skeleton-function are not highlighted and

     - change sequence of alignment.png first not aligned, second aligned
     - Too difficult: slide of extensibility, showing Emacs
       self-documenting help system for a template function
** Freeze
   - Documentation of installation, usage and configuration!
     + C-c C-{w,y,x}
     + sending to classics
   - Menu for checking availablity for the X11 helper functions
   - List of all new functions <- bug-report.sh
** Deficiencies:
   - Highlighting :: Experimental user variable highlighting
		     does not take into account:
     + clearing of variables and
     + usage of variables before their definitions (uninitialised
       variables)
     + the variable fontification clashes with Ansys specifiers
     + string substitution of %variables% in strings does not highlight
	them in the proper variable face
   - Highlighting :: A label :LABEL may appear behind the /input
                     command and is not highlighted as label
   - Highlighting :: An apostrophy clashes with the Ansys "char"
                     specifier Keybinding: M-Tab is captured under
                     Windows and some GNU-Linux desktops Workaround: Press
                     instead of M-Tab (ALT + TAB) the ESC key and then
                     the Tab key (ESC, TAB) or apply the command from
                     the menu bar
   - Keybinding :: M-j: When there is already a `&' in a format command
                   (like *msg, *vwrite, *mwrite)
                   ansys-indent-format-line inserts a redundant one
   - Completion :: Of parametric function parentheses
		   completes redundant closing parentheses
   - Completion :: A mouse selection from the *Ansys-completion* buffer
                   is only inserted upcased.
   - Completion :: Ansys command 'C***' will not be completed
   - Skeleton :: Mouse selection of -structural-template does not work
                 (because of stipulated user text input from this skeleton)
   - Navigation ::  C-c { does not skip an overlay in a number-block
                   (M-{ does it though))
   - Keybinding :: C-c C-j jjj not working with Emacs version < Emacs-24

** Procedures
   - GNU-Linux :: instead of GNU/Linux as FSF suggesting ;-)
   - Mode Help :: keyboard input is quoted in "", emphasizing in `' and
                  keys in <>
   - APDL templates :: minimal working examples ending with -template
   - Menu :: -> indicates the following sub menu entry ->
   - M-x compile :: ALL ;-)

    GH-wiki is repo with write access for world, separate from the A-M repo!

** Freeze proceedures
  - check whether all undocumented commands
    [[elisp:(find-tag "Ansys_undocumented_commands")]]
    are still working in V 162
  - (tags-search "-TODO-")
  - (tags-search "-FIXME-")
  - checkdoc, -ansys-template.el, -ansys-process.el, -mode.el done except
    \\<keymap> & \\[function]
  - README -- installation (Emacs Wiki format) and accompanying files,
       features, news, history
  - update the mode help, update version numbers, default specifiers
  - update defcustom list in ./bug-report.sh -> ansys-submit-bug-report
  - update/complete skeletons menu

  - check Emacs versions on longterm OS systems compile with 24.X,
    then pretests, emacs-snapshots, clash with Emacs releases (yearly
    Emacs cycle)?

** Release
  - Add the latest news from NEWS.org to the README.org

  - publication emails (with tutorial and news):

    The project is hosted on

    [[https://github.com/dieter-wilhelm/apdl-mode]]

    Where you will find the latest development version.

    Stable versions and prebuild packages are on the releases page:

** Ideas for further versions
*** Parameter help and documentation
    - Enable a mouse button to unhide hidden regions, enable an
      interactive way to unhide regions, when in the region: Return
      opens hidden region, ...
    - dynamic completion and help of parameter options, depending on
      the contex like the one in bash
    - makeinfo documentation with org-mode ox exporter
    - make completion of templates with <mouse 1> button additionally
      to <mouse 2> as in -complete-symbol.
    - create a function showing deprecated elements and their
      replacement.  Inspirations from eldoc-mode, show replacements of
      deprecated elements?
    - create a reference card
    - show list of license products and their license feature names or
      translate it in the license status from the licensing guide
      (product variable table)
    - C-c C-v show (optionally) only variables defined up to current
      cursor line.  Make the line number display in
      `ansys-display-variables' (hyper-)links to the corresponding code
      line in the respective APDL file.  (See `occur' function.)  Or
      use the imenu mechanism for this and display the variables in the
      speedbar. Count the number of user variables when displaying them
    - refcard, etc; Emacs help guidelines
      GNU programming guideline: More requires?,
    - display alternatives to/swap deprecated element types
    - M-? Help: parametric functions are not explained with the help
      command
    - M-? Help: if there are ignored characters behind the keyword, the
      keyword is not found
    - M-? the command help does not work when there are solver ignored
      characters behind the unique command name, example: *VWROOOOM.
    - M-?: following a variable allocation with `='
    - M-?: In the last empty line displays overlay below command
      instead above
    - Provide Ansys command completion and command-help in comint
      buffer
    - Include all inquiry functions (see UPF documentation)
    - Include the _RETURN value of the solid modelling commands into
      their help strings of parameter help.
*** Ansys process and interpreter buffer
    example: gnuplot-mode
    - call to start the Ansys solution results tracker for .nlh (xml
      see file:file.nlh, contact forces) and convergence .gst (binary?,
      coded? file:file.gst)
    - implement something like [[file:nlhist.sh]] for .cnd files (xml see
      file:file.cnd) or use the new libxml parser ;-)
    - make display-buffer "*Ansys*" optional when sending commands to
      the Ansys process
    - use Ansys *env variables* like AWP_ROOT140 for checking
      installation directories
    - check also the license status for hpc licenses if
      -no-of-processors is greater then 3
    - implement ANSWAIT variable
    - autoloading of: -license-file, -license-program functions
    - dbus support of workbench or integrating emacs in workbench?
    - insert skeleton with C-c C-s i, send line C-c C-c ccc
    - warn when C-c C-c tries to send a block command (complete to full
      block?)
    - take care when region isn't complete in -send-to-ansys (send whole line)
    - C-c C-c skips empty lines and comments this is not always desirable
      -> make this optional -> filter process input?
    - C-c C-q, C-c C-u and C-c C-c sequences are not shown (and stored)
      in the comint buffer
    - make filter of -license-status optional
    - optimise -start-run with query of y (start immediately),n
      (exit),e (change params),C-h (help)
    - Splice any input line behind the BEGIN: symbol in the *Ansys*
      buffer
    - Enable one solver run for every Ansys macro buffer
    - indicate with activation/inactivation of menu items that an
      asynchronous job is already running or not.
    - show/mark sent lines in apdl file C-c C-u, C-c C-c,
      + with fringes
      + with background
      + maximum line
      + reset highlighting, when?
    - provide Ansys `y' request and carriage return? superflouous?  a
      single `y' does the trick
    - Killing a buffer with a running process now asks a confirmation.
      You can remove this query in two ways: either removing
      `process-kill-buffer-query-function' from
      `kill-buffer-query-functions' or setting the appropriate process
      flag with `set-process-query-on-exit-flag'.
     - finding an Ansys /filnam command in current macro file and
       suggesting this as current job-name optionally kill old job when
       called again with working run warn and optionally remove the
       ansys lock file before starting a run
     - search in -job for /filn arguments as default job name like in
       -display-error-file
*** Skeletons, outline and abbrevs
    - show a preview buffer with the outline headlines
    - -skeleton-select is a bit thin, not yet finished?
    - add a preview mode, with its own keymap for faster editing and
      copying, like dired
    - enhance abbrev definitions for *create, *dowhile logics:
    - use the Ansys sample input listing for template-examples
    - additional dialog boxes with:
      /ui,anno,ksel...,wpse,help,query,copy
    - make outline string in skeletons configurable
    - spider beams, _bolt.mac, screw.mac, Mohr-Coulomb criterion
    - rework concept with respect to the Ansys menu structure sort
      skeletons in menu. Concept: 1.) Ansys Workflow 2.) specialised
      macro library
    - Make skeleton-header properly working (info "(autotype)")
    - Optimise templates: completing-read, read-from-minibuffer
    - abbrev `d does not indent properly in another block level
    - Implement choice when completing *IF commands (*ELSEIF or *ENDIF
      ?THEN?).
    - Warn when including skeleton in read only file.
    - skeleton for numbering ansys-skeleton-numbering-controls
      (skeleton-insert docu)
    - suggestions with auto-completion of
      kp,line,area,volu,node,elem,tabn,sval
    - negation, what negation? TODO:
    - skeleton for skipping code *if,then *else*endif if selection:
      wrap around and indenting *go/*if label is not fontified at the
      command line (restriction of 7 characters with out the colon.)
      must *go:label be unambiguous?
*** Miscellaneous
    - hash or signature file for packages
    - show content of matlib/ folder
    - add to -display-variables a prefix argument for showing the value
      of the variable around point, or center the variables window...
    - customisation option for a the web browser of -browse-ansys-help
    - ideas for preview also of a/the macro directory?
    - put graphics dlls in windows package
    - LSDYN support, see lsdyna.el
    - embedded calc :: include in hacking.mac
    - Alignment :: alignment "section" is not clearly defined in function
		   -align
    - alignment :: extend to vector definitions
		   t(1,0) = 20,300,3094,
		   t(1,1) =  3,  4,   9,
    - Utility for clearing files like .rst, ... or using dired, clear_files.sh?
      with listing listing of file types
    - Configure the highlighting colours with black on white background
    - C-j, M-j are not skipping to `,' whith default command (from second
      line onwards)!
    - supply command for clearing recursively not important process files:
      .rst, .log, ..., supply a customisaton variable
    - narrow, outline, transparent-font: eblocks, nblocks by default?
    - add notes for parameter help of undocumented commands (alist)
    - create filter variable for hiding not installed license types
      ("aiiges" "aihexa") or better regexp filter "ai.*\\|acf.*"
    - commands shorter than 4 chars are not allowed with additional chars
      adjust this to -highlighting-level 0
    - Make Ansys-Mode also working solely with ansys-mode.el??
    - make M-C-h more intelligent like M-h (if mark...)
    - speed concern: replace -find-duplicate-p with function argument to
      add-to-list
    - For non-comint-mode usage: display .log file with tail mode
    - is outline-mode enabled? no! make default?, outline
    - take care of setup procedure: v110/ansys/apdl/start110.ans
      /MPLIB,READ,/ansys_inc/v110/ansys/matlib
    - removing/renaming/checking abort file?
    - Are characters behind unique commands shorter than 4 characters
      possible? No /sol(u) sufficient? Yes condensed input line ($)
      behind commands without arguments possible? Yes have a look in
      -variable-defining-commands!  Warn when - unintentionally -
      arguments are used for Ansys commands which do not allow
      arguments.  Or implement some auto-newline feature?  But
      problematic in condensed command lines or when applying code
      comments!
    - undocumented ask parameter
    - mode-line-format nil);no mode line for this buffer Unambiguous
    - Emacs: old-style backquotes?  used in the old template macro system
    - completion of function names: cursor should end within parentheses
    - better hints for auto-insertion features
    - up/down-block when we are over a begin-keyword and in a block-end
      line
    - component names are fontified as variables! separate them cmlist?
    - format string for *VWRITE: line(s) below, in parens, when FORTRAN
      format specifiers are used, keyword SEQU povides row numbers, up
      to 19 parameters are allowed
    - remove vestiges of ansys-mod.el for making ansys-mode.el GPL
      proof.  Check whether octave-mod.el really is GPL compliant, use
      -ctave-mod.el from 1997, kill octave-mod.el afterwards in
      makefile read every symbol docu string ->NEW_C or _C or OCTAVE_C
    - replace/extend column-ruler with ruler-mode or ruler implemented as
      overlay in buffer
    - make everything completely customisable, eg auto-insert stuff
      customisable enable, Emacs customisation of auto-insert-query
    - Fontify *completion list* distinguishing elements: commands,
      functions and keywords.
    - provide a list of options for the -license function, set this
      function in the defcustom lmstat -a etc.
    - auto-indent-switch as defcustom?
    - inhibit the unnecessary blink-matching-block display when closing a
      block behind a block-end keyword
    - highlight matching block keywords (similar to show-paren-mode) when
      point is at keyword
    - Implement highlighting of bracket pairs with the correct level in
      Ansys GET- and parametric- functions.
    - highlighting of plot commands inside the /GCMD command
    - DEFSUBSTs with DEFUNs inside aren't particularly helpful?
    - Emphasise better implied (colon) loops n,(1:6),(2:12:2) => n,1,2
      $ n,2,4 $... (little used, I know, but any ideas going beyond the
      colon?).
    - startup screen for Ansys mode: Mode help, Ansys version,
      supressing the startup screen 'ansys-mode-startup-message maybe
      as advice when sluggish -> compiliation
    - Enable choice for /show,3d or x11 (-start-graphics)
    - Provide a way to send commands to the tcl-tk Ansys gui (x11
      programming).
*** Ansys syntax restrictions not (yet) accounted for
    - Parentheses can only be nested 4 levels deep and only up to 9
      operations (+,-,*,...) within these set of parentheses
    - PATH name is restricted to 8 chars
    - *SET parameter strings may only be 32 character long!
    - Character parameters are restricted to only 8 characters.
    - *MSG command can only have 9 additional continuation lines
    - Code line restriction of 640 characters
    - Block level restriction of 20 levels of nested *DO loops (except
      with /INPUT and *USE)
    - Block level restriction of 10 levels of nested *IF blocks
    - Macro level restriction: 20 macros
*** Unknown Ansys stuff
    - what the heck is the *UILIST command?
    - Is hyper56 a valid element?
