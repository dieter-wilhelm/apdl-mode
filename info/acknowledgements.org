My acknowledgements to Tim Read and Geoff Foster for their
ansys-mod.el from 1997 which triggered the idea in 2006 to start
APDL-Mode.

Parts of APDL-Mode were based on octave-mod.el: Copyright (C) 1997
Free Software Foundation, Inc.  Authors: [[mailto:Kurt.Hornik@wu-wien.ac.at][Kurt Hornik]] and [[mailto:jwe@bevo.che.wisc.edu][John Eaton]].

I received, moreover, support and feedback from many individuals.
Thank you very much!
