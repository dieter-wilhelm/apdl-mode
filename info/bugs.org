APDL-Mode was tested using Ansys v201 and v211 under Windows 10 and 11
with Emacs-29.1.  Under GNU-Linux the mode was developed and checked
under both Emacs-24.3 and Emacs-29.1

Feedback is always welcome.  If you have issues while installing and
running this mode or want to suggest improvements you have the
following options:

1) Write an email to the [[mailto:dieter@duenenhof-wilhelm.de][mode maintainer]].  Please trigger a bug report
   form from the APDL-Mode menu or by calling the function
   `apdl-submit-bug-report'.  Even if you have not configured Emacs to
   send emails, please copy the content of the mail template for the
   maintainer.

2) You might issue bug reports or feature requests at APDL-Mode's
   [[https://github.com/dieter-wilhelm/apdl-mode/issues][issues site]]

3) And you can leave comments and hints at the [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/APDLMode][APDL-Mode page]] of the
   [[https://www.emacswiki.org][Emacs Wiki]].

# - Write an email to the mode maintainer, please trigger a bug
#   report form from the APDL menu or by calling the function
#   `apdl-submit-bug-report' with \"\\[apdl-submit-bug-report]\".
#   Even if you are not able to send emails directly via Emacs,
#   this is, at least, a mail template with possibly valuable
#   information like mode settings and Emacs internals.

# - You might also issue a bug report at GitHub's APDL-Mode site
#   https://github.com/dieter-wilhelm/apdl-mode/issues, where you
#   will also find the latest versions of APDL-Mode.

# - Or you can leave comments and hints at the [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/APDLMode][APDL-Mode page]] of Emacs
#   Wiki.
