For a compilation (and respective documentation) of available
APDL-Mode customisation it's best to open the mode's customisation
buffer either with the command `apdl-customise-ansys' or from the menu
bar -> 'APDL' -> 'Customise APDL Mode' and check interesting options.

Another way getting to the customisation facility is to open the
specific documentation of respective variables.  Let's change for
example the highlighting level which is stored in the customisation
variable `apdl-highlighting-level'.  Click on the hyperlink and you
will be presented with its help buffer in which you should click on
the underlined word 'customize' at the bottom.  Then you have the
convenient customisation functionalities for this particular variable
at hand.  You can set the value for the current session or add your
choices automatically in your initialisation file (often .emacs, the
emacs-lisp file in your home directory) for future sessions as well.

Alternatively you might include the following Elisp code snippet

#+texinfo: @lisp
     (setq apdl-highlighting-level 2)
     (setq apdl-dynamic-highlighting-flag t)
#+texinfo: @end lisp

directly into your .emacs file.  (Semicolon `;' is the comment
character.  Please check the configuration example `default.el'.)

For certain options to take effect without restarting Emacs, it's
necessary to reload APDL-Mode.  You can do this with the
interactive command `apdl-reload-apdl-mode' or with the
respective, toplevel APDL menu entry.
