APDL, [[https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSYS_Parametric_Design_Language][Ansys Parametric Design Language]] is the solver scripting
language of the mechanical FEA, Finite Element Analysis suite [[http://www.ansys.com][Ansys]],
ANalysis SYStem, registered TM.

APDL-Mode, is - in conjunction with the [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][GNU-Emacs]] editor - an advanced
APDL environment with features like, browsing the APDL reference
documentation, keyword completion and abbreviations, code templates
and code outlining / folding, dedicated highlighting, solver
communication (GNU-Linux only), license reporting, etc.  Please
convince yourself in the APDL-Mode in-depth documentation.

With the advent of the modern Ansys GUIs - like `WorkBench' or
`Discovery' - the usage of APDL as a wholesale modelling language has
waned for highly variable tasks which are expensive to script.  But,
nevertheless, APDL is here to stay: `WorkBench' operates exclusively
the Ansys solver with it!  It assembles and sends APDL input (.dat)
files to the solver.  For a true understanding of the GUI's inner
workings a study of their APDL code is prerequisite!  Moreover,
WorkBench is not supporting all MAPDL solver features.  So "Command
(APDL)" objects are used to enhance the GUI's modelling capabilities.

APDL-Mode is equally useful for studying solver (.dat) files which
were created by WorkBench.  And, especially, for writing WorkBench
`Command' objects and inspecting longer command snippets from other
sources.  Accessing the Ansys APDL reference documentation without
detour - this alone - is worth using APDL-Mode.

When you "Export" (or "Import") such a WorkBench "Command (APDL)"
object, it becomes associated with a file on disk and is accessible
for any kind of editor.  If you modify this file, the "File Status" in
Workbench changes and you can pull-in the updated content with the
"Refresh" button.
