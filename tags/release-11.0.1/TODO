* improve Ansys interpreter buffer with `comint-mode'
   gnuplot-mode
- C-c C-c does not work for large regions!
- ansys process status is not working properly process-sentinel?
- pick up ansys-process when renaming buffer file and restarting
  ansys-mode, otherwise process is without buffer
- warn when abandoning macro file with an associated Ansys process.
- C-c C-c shouldn't send empty lines in regions, especially at the
  end, to the solver.  Use a filter?
- provide Ansys `y' request and carriage return? superflouous?
- indicate with activation/inactivation of menu items that an
  asynchronous job is already running or not.
- check for EXIT command and wait some time to update the mode line
  run status correctly
- For non-comint-mode usage: display .log file with tail mode
- show sent lines in apdl file C-c C-u, C-c C-c,
-- with fringes
-- with background colour
-- maximum line
-- reset highlighting, when?

* Dissect skeleton into smaller more useful subjects   
- spider beams, _bolt.mac, screw.mac
- sort skeletons in menu
- preview skeletons!
   smaller ones in mini buffer
- optional setting of (Ansys-mode-)bookmarks?   
- rework concept with respect to the Ansys menu structure
- Make skeleton-header properly working (info "(autotype)")
- Optimise templates: completing-read, read-from-minibuffer abbrev `d
  does not indent properly in another block level Implement choice when
  completing *IF commands (*ELSEIF or *ENDIF ?THEN?).
-  Warn when including skeleton in read only file.
- skeleton for numbering ansys-skeleton-numbering-controls
(skeleton-insert docu)
- suggestion with auto-completion of kp,line,area,volu,node,elem,tabn,sval
- negation 
- skeleton for skipping code	 *if,then *else*endif
   if selection: wrap around and indenting
  *go/*if label is not fontified at the command line (restriction of 7 characters with out the colon.)
   must *go:label be unambiguous?

* M-? at last line -> args out of range

* add cmblock and cm assignments to the variable list

* correct *set assignment printout

* take care of setup procedure: v110/ansys/apdl/start110.ans
  /MPLIB,READ,/ansys_inc/v110/ansys/matlib

* Complete ansys-send-or-copy-above
- substring-no-properties

* C-c C-v show (optionally) only variables defined up to current cursor line

* C-c ] removes empty lines?

* C-j is not skipping to `,' whith default command (from second line onwards)!

* removing/renaming abort file?

* Improve ansys-show-command-parameters
- undocumented aks parameter
- explain also commented out commands   
- add undocumented-commands into the command help.
- nint, rand not yet in the help list Parameter help also for *GET and parametric functions e. g. nint().
- Include the _RETURN value of the solid modelling
commands into their help strings of parameter help.  
- mode-line-format nil);no mode line for this buffer Unambiguous
  Ansys commands with additional characters at the end are not found
  in the parameter help (C-c C-h) example: *VWROOOO

------------------------------
12.0.1

0.) update keywords to V12.0
1.) remaining font-lock issues, fontifiction levels
2.) code dissection & gnu coding style
3.) possible language additions
4.) feature freeze & checking
   
* Sluggish font-locking? 12.0.1
- choice of fontification level
- simplify: multi file package -> rework of makefile -> README
   (require 'feature)

* Rework README generation (from "makefile")
   
* implement C-c { and } like C-x z (repeate) zzzz
   
* Emacs: old-style backquotes?
   used in the old template macro system


------------------------------

* ansys-license-status
- filter license-usage output, make it more readable
  Argument specifying license type for for -license-status

split
  0.) ansys-mode.el						X
  1.) highlighting patterns ->	ansys-highlight.el	X
  2.) templates <-> menus? ->	ansys-templates.el	?
  3.) interactive stuff ->		ansys-interactive.el	system-type-p
  4.) documentation ->		README, INSTALL, TODO?

*create is only completed by *end

completion of function names: cursor should stay within parentheses

?clear message: ansys-mode perform auto insertion?
?condition -highlight in the fontlock variable?

c*** highlighting

comment above user variable problem

*VAR*VAR highlighting problem

==== Important ====

does setting of -hook trigger immediately the effects or is a
restart necessary? other function as well

-up/down-block when we are over a begin-keyword and in a block-end
line

read ansys-license-file from env, supply sane standard Ansys values
for the helper programs and check for existance

concentrate variable defining functions for user variable search
and - display.  Variables are getting overwritten with Ansys
keywords.

component names also fontified as variables? or separate cmlist?

format string for *VWRITE: line(s) below, in parens, when FORTRAN
format specifiers are used, keyword SEQU povides row numbers, up to
19 parameters are allowed

what the heck is the *UILIST command?

make M-C-h more intelligent like M-h

Enable input directly in the Ansys output buffer (*Ansys*) like in
the *shell*, *math* or *Python* buffer (run-python)
a.) enable highlighting of the *Ansys* buffer -> ansys-interactive-mode
b.) splice any input line behind the BEGIN: symbol in the *Ansys* buffer

remove vestiges of ansys-mod.el for making ansys-mode.el GPL
proof.  Check whether octave-mod.el really is GPL compliant, use
octave-mod.el from 1997, kill octave-mod.el afterwards in makefile
read every symbol docu string ->NEW_C or _C or OCTAVE_C

==== Less Important ====

*MSG command can only have 9 additional continuation lines

FIXMEs

generalise -insert-pi in code line ($ PI=...), in comment (\n
Pi=...)

replace/extend column-ruler with ruler-mode or ruler implemented as
overlay in buffer

Capitalized variable fontification clashes with small letter Ansys
predicates.  Fx=3 -> *GET,Fx,fsum,,item,fx, make fontification case
dependent?

startup screen for Ansys mode: Mode help, Ansys version, supressing
the startup screen
'ansys-mode-startup-message
 maybe as advice when sluggish -> compiliation

Try to ask only for the installation directory for the -license-file,
-program, etc.  variables.  Read some information from getenv.

make everything completely customisable, eg auto-insert stuff
customisable enable Emacs customisation of auto-insert-query and

Fontify *completion list* distinguishing elements: commands,
functions and keywords.

sort customisation options for processes into subgroup
(defgroup octave-inferior nil
  "Running Octave as an inferior Emacs process."
  :group 'octave)

provide a list of options for the -license function, set this
function in the defcustom lmstat -a etc.

Optimisation (look at regexp with *), nested repetition regexp
operators

-start-ansys
finding an Ansys /filnam command in current macro file
and suggesting this as current job-name optionally
kill old job when called again with working run
warn and optionally remove the ansys lock file before starting a run

Enable one run for every Ansys macro buffer

Enable choice for /show,3d or x11

Wrong highlighting of variables in /com, C*** text strings
variable highlighting overwrites ansys commands with the same name
dynamic highlighting is only implemented for .mac files

Comments in c*** commands are not possible and highlighted wrongly

multiple cleanup:_typ= $ _nm= $ _tag= $ _acnt= $ _temp=: variable
fontification is not working

*DO parameters are not restricted to the respective block deleting
parameters with `PARAM=' or `*SET,PARAM,' is not taken into account
when dynamically highlighting user variables.  Redefinition of
variables leaves the old definitions valid ->invalidate
font-locking there.  Variable highlighting in strings is not
working (string substitution).  display-user-variables displays
message strings as well

make the line number display in `ansys-display-variables'
(hyper-)links to the corresponding code line in the respective APDL
file.  (See `occur' function.)  Or use the imenu mechanism for this
and display the variables in the speedbar

Better documentation, info file, refcard, etc; GNU programming
guideline: More requires?, indicate replacement of standard Emacs
facilities (e. g M-C-n, M-C-p), profiling, major mode conventions:
multiple loading of this mode?, XEmacs testing.

Provide customisable choice whether commands, functions and/or
elements are assembled in the completion list.

auto-indent-switch as defcustom?

inhibit the unnecessary blink-matching-block display when closing a
block behind a block-end keyword

tool-tips for the menus

highlight matching block keywords (similar to show-paren-mode) when
point is at keyword

Implement highlighting of brackets with the correct level in Ansys
GET- and parametric- functions.

highlighting of plot commands inside the /GCMD command

Warn when - unintentionally - arguments are used for Ansys commands
which do not allow arguments.  Or implement some auto-newline
feature?  But problematic in condensed command lines
or when applying code comments!

Indicate that character parameters are restricted to only 8
characters.

DEFSUBSTs with DEFUNs inside aren't particularly helpful?

ansys-indicate-empty-lines also for non-window systems (with
overlays)

see www.apdl.de for further ideas and extensions

Emphasise better implied (colon) loops n,(1:6),(2:12:2) => n,1,2 $
n,2,4 $... (little used, I know, but any ideas going beyond the
colon?).  *REPEATE command might be interesting

Code line restriction of 640 characters is not taken care of.
Block level restriction of 20 levels of nested *DO loops (except
with /INPUT and *USE)
Block level restriction of 10 levels of nested *IF blocks
Macro level restriction: 20 macros
