* Introduction
** GNU Emacs editor support for working with ANSYS FEA
   This [[http://code.google.com/p/ansys-mode/][project]] supports your workflows with the FEA (Finite Element
   Analysis) suite [[http://www.ansys.com][ANSYS]] (ANalysis SYStem, registered TM).
#+LaTeX: \\[.2cm]
   It provides `ANSYS-Mode', an add-on to the [[http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][GNU Emacs]] editor for
   investigating and coding APDL (Ansys Parametric Design Language).
   The mode offers also managing and communication capabilities for
   various ANSYS processes, like interactive code debugging with the
   solver or inquiring the license manager status, etc.  Some features
   are quite sophisticated but its documentation is accessible for
   ANSYS users with little Emacs experience.
#+LaTeX: \\[.2cm]
   [[http://www.gnu.org/home.en.html][GNU]] (Gnu's Not Unix) Emacs is an up-to-date, powerful and
   extensible - yet free - editor. High quality software available for
   every operating system where ANSYS is running.
#+LaTeX: \\[.4cm]
   In the following *C-c* or *M-c* means typing the <CTRL> or <ALT>
   key together with the <c> key.
  
* Download
** Download ANSYS-Mode together with the Emacs editor \\ Remarkably there are *no* costs and license restrictions also for commercial use
  Most convenient is taking the pre-configured ANSYS-Mode in
  conjunction with the latest Emacs editor binary for Windows 64
  bit from the Google Code [[http://code.google.com/p/ansys-mode/downloads/list][download page]].
  
#+ATTR_HTML: width="1200"
  [[./download.png]]
  
* Installation
** Install ANSYS-Mode together with Emacs
  Extract the former zip archive to an arbitrary location on your file
  system.  Optionally you might install Emacs shortcut icons for the
  system tray with /addpm.exe/ in Emacs' /bin/ folder.

#+ATTR_LaTeX: width=11cm
  [[./emacs_bin_folder.png]]

 In this list /runemacs.exe/ is the actual editor executable.

* Usage
** Open an APDL macro file with Emacs
  Start the Emacs editor and open /fontification.mac/ in the
  /site-lisp/ folder or any other APDL file (with the extensions
  /mac/, /inp/, /dat/ or /anf/, otherwise additionally type *M-x
  ansys-mode* and <RET>).

#+ATTR_LaTeX: height=7.5cm
  [[./find_file_dialog.png]]

** Explore the ANSYS-Mode menu
  Everything should work also system dependent functions, like
  browsing the APDL help with *C-c C-b*, if ANSYS is installed in its
  default folder /C:Program Files/ under Win64, otherwise, you can
  easily reconfigure. (All described features can be executed through
  the ANSYS-Mode menu or with keyboard shortcuts.)

#+ATTR_LaTeX: height=7.5cm
  [[./ansys_menu.png]]

* Selected ANSYS-Mode Features  
** Use the ANSYS-Mode APDL command help
  Please type *M-?* (alternatively: *C-c ?*) on a code line and you
  will see the APDL command's description together with its parameter
  syntax.  You can continue working, this temporary overlay (here in
  yellow) remains visible for a while   during your editing.
  
#+ATTR_LaTeX: height=7.5cm

** Select and insert templates from the menu into your code \\ Screenshot with the ANSYS Classics GUI (left) and Emacs (right) on Win64 

#+ATTR_LaTeX: height=8cm
#+ATTR_HTML: width="1200"
   [[./template_menu.png]]

** Preview the extensible APDL code templates
   Before inserting a code template completely you are able to inspect
   the content in a preview window and you can copy the most relevant
   snippets (see below and next slide).

#+ATTR_LaTeX: height=7.5cm
   [[./template.png]]

** Take a short-cut to the code template preview
   Type *C-c C-s* to select a template name, use the <TAB> key to
   complete or open a completion window of available subjects.

#+ATTR_LaTeX: height=7.5cm
   [[./template_selection.png]]

** Check auto-insertion and outline your code (tree view)
  Create a new APDL file with the suffix 
#+BEGIN_LaTeX
`{\sl .mac}'
#+END_LaTeX
  and let Emacs auto-insert
  a skeleton with `outline' headings.  Collapse the content to a tree
  view with *C-c @ C-t* and open all (*C-c @ C-a*) again.

#+ATTR_LaTeX: height=7.5cm
  [[./outline.png]]
  
** Utilise completions of all APDL symbols (around 2000)
  Move the cursor behind a character (here 'c') or word fragment and
  type <ESC> <TAB> or *C-M-i* for completing up to date APDL command-,
  element- and function names.

#+ATTR_LaTeX: height=7.5cm
  [[./completion.png]]
  
** Open a summary window of your APDL variables
  Type *C-c C-v* to receive a summary window (see below) of all your
  variables definitions (also implicit) in the current APDL file.

#+ATTR_LaTeX: height=7.5cm
  [[./variable_buffer.png]]

** Structure your variable assignments
  Move the cursor to a variable definition paragraph or mark (here in
  yellow) some definitions and type *C-c C-a* to align them.

#+ATTR_LaTeX: height=7.5cm
  [[./alignment.png]]

** Use the Emacs integrated, programmable RPN calculator  
   Type *C-x* * * to open the calculator, type *y* for pasting results
   directly into the APDL file. *q* to quit the 'Emacs Calc' windows.

#+ATTR_LaTeX: height=7.5cm
  [[./calculator.png]]

** Debug your code interactively with the solver (Unix only)
   You can run the ANSYS solver/interpreter under Emacs and send
   code lines from the APDL window (above) with *C-c C-c* directly to
   this process. Below you get an interactive solver output window and
   on the left hand side the corresponding ANSYS graphics.

#+ATTR_HTML: width="1200"
#+ATTR_LaTeX: height=6.5cm
  [[./process.png]]
** Display the license status and graphics (also PDF) on UNIX
   In Emacs' mid-section you see the license state (*C-c C-l*)
   and left Emacs window (below) a thumbnail view of images from a
   folder.

#+ATTR_LaTeX: height=7.3cm
#+ATTR_HTML: width="1200"
   [[./license.png]]

** Arrange the ANSYS-Mode windows to your needs \\ The image shows an Emacs 23.2 frame (in reversed colour mode and compiled with the GTK+ toolkit under Linux) with a ripped off ANSYS menu field

# The
# APDL file is in the right window with the (experimental) user variable
# highlighting switched on and a help overlay (in yellow background)
# activated. The smaller windows on the left hand side are showing the
# `Variable definitions buffer' of the same file and a preview buffer of
# a certain code template, respectively.

* Configuration

** Configure system dependent aspects and user options
#   \\Mainly the ANSYS version and its installation directory
    The mode comes pre-configured for a default installation of ANSYS
    14.5 for Win64.  If a functionality is missing please adjust
    either of:
*** The well commented configuration file /default.el/
          :PROPERTIES:
          :BEAMER_env: block
          :BEAMER_envargs: C[T]
          :BEAMER_col: 0.5
          :END:
#+ATTR_LaTeX: width=5.5cm
  [[./default_el.png]]

  ... and restart Emacs. 
*** Or change the settings with Emacs' customisation system
          :PROPERTIES:
          :BEAMER_env: block
          :BEAMER_envargs: <2->
          :BEAMER_envargs: C[T]
          :BEAMER_col: 0.5
          :END:
#+ATTR_LaTeX: width=5.5cm
    [[./customisation_system.png]]

  ... and reload ANSYS-Mode. 
* Documentation and Licensing

** Get to know Emacs and check out its tutorial
  Newcomers to Emacs should take the guided [[http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/tour/][online tour]] to get a
  background of its capabilities and fire up the interactive tutorial
  (*C-h t*) which is translated to various languages.

#+ATTR_LaTeX: height=7.5cm
  [[./emacs_tutorial.png]]

** Use the ANSYS-Mode built-in documentation
   Please type *C-h m* for the ANSYS-Mode help, especially for the
   usage and keybindings of this mode.  At the beginning is also a
   brief introduction of basic Emacs concepts.

#+ATTR_LaTeX: height=7.5cm
   [[./mode_help.png]]

** You might read further ANSYS-Mode documentation

*** Hands-on tutorial:
    You will find this more in-depth tutorial included in the mode's
    archives on Google Code's [[http://code.google.com/p/ansys-mode/downloads/list][download page]] or [[http://duenenhof-wilhelm.de/dieter/ansys-mode_tutorial/APDL_tutorial.html][online]].
*** Installation:
    More detailed instructions are necessary if you are not using the
    mode bundled with Emacs for Windows.  Please have a look in the
    /README/ file.  For an online version see the [[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/AnsysMode][ANSYS-Mode page]] at
    the EmacsWiki.
    
*** News and project history:
    They are placed in the mode's accompanying /NEWS/ file

*** Licensing and costs:
    This is free and open software, there are *no costs* and effectively *no
    restrictions* for you using Emacs and ANSYS-Mode also commerically.
    Both are under the [[http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html][GPL]] (Gnu Puplic License) described in the
    /LICENSE/ file.
* Help and Bugs
** Search for help, report bugs and issues
  Besides the documentation, have a look in the section 'Issues and
  bug reports' at [[http://code.google.com/p/ansys-mode/issues/list][Google's Code site]] or send an [[mailto:dieter@duenenhof-wilhelm.de][email]] to the maintainer.
  Please use the ANSYS-Mode bug report functionality, which might
  provide helpful status information.

* Summary
** Use ANSYS-Mode appropriate to your needs \\ The relevance of APDL remains tall: `WorkBench' operates *exclusively* the ANSYS solver with it!  While for many applications WorkBench is taking over the "code authoring" part from the user, for a *true understanding* of this tool the study of APDL is still prerequisite.   Moreover, code APDL only for *repetitive* tasks and command snippets, *extending* WB.

*** Basic APDL *viewer*
         :PROPERTIES:
         :BEAMER_env: block
         :BEAMER_envargs: C[t]
#         :BEAMER_col: 0.5
         :END:
    Navigating in WB solver input files, discerning relevant
    information through highlighting, quickly analysing APDL commands
    with the built-in help or studying their detailed help in your
    browser.
*** Earnest APDL *editor*
         :PROPERTIES:
         :BEAMER_env: block
         :BEAMER_envargs: C[t]
#         :BEAMER_col: 0.5
         :END:
    Shortcut keybindings, outlining, code templates, completions,
    auto-indentation, abbreviations, auto-insertion.
*** Advanced APDL *environment*
         :PROPERTIES:
         :BEAMER_env: block
         :BEAMER_envargs: C[t]
#         :BEAMER_col: 0.5
         :END:
    Solver communication/feedback - hybrid between coding and
    debugging (UNIX only), retrieving license states, error file
    viewing, abort file handling, extending APDL templates, ...
