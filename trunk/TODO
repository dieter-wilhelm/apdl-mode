* Deficiencies:
  - Highlighting :: Experimental user variable highlighting
		    does not take into account:
    + clearing of variables and
    + usage of variables before their definitions (uninitialised
      variables)
    + the variable fontification might clash with Ansys specifiers
    + string substitution of %variables% in strings does not highlight
       them in the proper variable face
  - Highlighting :: A label :LABEL may appear behind the /input
                    command and is not highlighted as label
  - Highlighting :: An apostrophy clashes with the Ansys "char"
                    specifier Keybinding: M-Tab is captured under
                    Windows and some Linux desktops Workaround: Press
                    instead of M-Tab (ALT + TAB) the ESC key and then
                    the Tab key (ESC, TAB) or apply the command from
                    the menu bar
  - Keybinding :: M-j: When there is already a `&' in a format command
                  (like *msg, *vwrite, *mwrite)
                  ansys-indent-format-line inserts a redundant one
  - Completion :: Of parametric function parentheses
		  completes redundant closing parentheses
  - Completion :: A mouse selection from the *Ansys-completion* buffer
                  is only inserted upcased.
  - Completion :: Ansys command 'C***' will not be completed   
* v13.0.x, v14.0.x:

     switching off the overlay
   - create an option for the number of processors for -start-ansys
     (/config,nproc is obsolete)

Subject: New release 13.0.1: Editor support for working with Ansys APDL files & processes

Hi,

finally a new release for Ansys V13 of Ansys mode for the Emacs
editor, downloadable from:

http://code.google.com/p/ansys-mode

You'll find there also the latest stable version of Emacs for Windows
with Ansys mode preconfigured and ready to go.  Just unpack it and use
the Editor for your APDL .mac files.

Below you'll find a summary of its features and what's new in this
release.

#+STARTUP: showall
# local variables:
# mode: org
# end:
* Ideas for further versions
** Parameter help and documentation
   - inspirations from eldoc-mode, show replacements of deprecated
     elements?
   - count number of user variables when displaying them
   - documentation in info format, refcard, etc; Emacs help guidelines
     GNU programming guideline: More requires?,
   - display alternatives to/swap deprecated element types
   - M-? Help: parametric functions are not explained with the help
     command
   - M-? Help: if there are ignored characters behind the keyword, the
     keyword is not found
   - M-? the command help does not work when there are solver ignored
     characters behind the unique command name, example: *VWROOOOM.
   - M-? Provide also help for commented out commands
   - M-?: following a variable allocation with `='
   - M-?: remove also old overlay when new keyword is not found
   - Provide Ansys command completion and command-help in comint
     buffer
   - Include all inquiry functions (see UPF documentation)
   - Include the _RETURN value of the solid modelling commands into
     their help strings of parameter help.
** Ansys process and interpreter buffer
   example: gnuplot-mode
   - autoloading of: -license-file, -license-program functions
   - dbus support of workbench or integrating emacs in workbench?
   - insert skeleton with C-c C-s i, send line C-c C-c ccc
   - warn when C-c C-c tries to send a block command (complete to full
     block?)
   - take care when region isn't complete in -send-to-ansys (send whole line)
   - C-c C-c skips empty lines and comments this is not always desirable
     -> make this optional -> filter process input?
   - C-c C-q, C-c C-u and C-c C-c sequences are not shown (and stored)
     in the comint buffer
   - make filter of -license-status optional
   - optimise -start-run with query of y (start immediately),n
     (exit),e (change params),C-h (help)
   - Splice any input line behind the BEGIN: symbol in the *Ansys*
     buffer
   - Enable one solver run for every Ansys macro buffer
   - indicate with activation/inactivation of menu items that an
     asynchronous job is already running or not.
   - show/mark sent lines in apdl file C-c C-u, C-c C-c,
     + with fringes
     + with background
     + maximum line
     + reset highlighting, when?
   - provide Ansys `y' request and carriage return? superflouous?  a
     single `y' does the trick
   - Killing a buffer with a running process now asks a confirmation.
     You can remove this query in two ways: either removing
     `process-kill-buffer-query-function' from
     `kill-buffer-query-functions' or setting the appropriate process
     flag with `set-process-query-on-exit-flag'.
    - finding an Ansys /filnam command in current macro file and
      suggesting this as current job-name optionally kill old job when
      called again with working run warn and optionally remove the
      ansys lock file before starting a run
    - search in -job for /filn arguments as default job name like in
      -display-error-file
** Skeletons and abbrevs
   - additional dialog boxes with:
     /ui,anno,ksel...,wpse,help,query,copy
   - make outline string in skeletons configurable
   - spider beams, _bolt.mac, screw.mac, Mohr-Coulomb criterion
   - rework concept with respect to the Ansys menu structure sort
     skeletons in menu. Concept: 1.) Ansys Workflow 2.) specialised
     macro library
   - Make skeleton-header properly working (info "(autotype)")
   - Optimise templates: completing-read, read-from-minibuffer
   - abbrev `d does not indent properly in another block level
   - Implement choice when completing *IF commands (*ELSEIF or *ENDIF
     ?THEN?).
   - Warn when including skeleton in read only file.
   - skeleton for numbering ansys-skeleton-numbering-controls
     (skeleton-insert docu)
   - suggestions with auto-completion of
     kp,line,area,volu,node,elem,tabn,sval
   - negation, what negation? TODO:
   - skeleton for skipping code *if,then *else*endif if selection:
     wrap around and indenting *go/*if label is not fontified at the
     command line (restriction of 7 characters with out the colon.)
     must *go:label be unambiguous?
** Miscellaneous
   - Alignment: Alignment of variables works only reliably for the
     setting of real constants
   - Alignment: alignment "section" is not clearly defined in function
     -align
   - Alignment: there must be at least one space between = and
     variable/value

x	=	0.4	    !laskd
y	=      33.0	    ! alskdl
xzv	= 9999990.3	    !
llk	=	0.333333333 !bla
al_	=      00.40
aslf√∂as =     304
i	=	4.	    !as
ka	= .4		    !salkd
kasd	=	3./0.4
xxx	= asin(3.0)

   - extend alignment to vector definitions
     t(1,0) = 20,300,3094,
     t(1,1) =  3,  4,   9,
   - Utility for clearing files like .rst, ... or using dired?
   - E23.2 mouse-choose-completion obsolete
   - Configure the highlighting colours with black on white background
   - C-j, M-j are not skipping to `,' whith default command (from second
     line onwards)!
   - supply command for clearing recursively not important process files:
     .rst, .log, ..., supply a customisaton variable
   - Ansys mode debian .deb package
   - narrow, outline, transparent-font: eblocks, nblocks by default?
   - add notes for parameter help of undocumented commands (alist)
   - create filter variable for hiding not installed license types
     ("aiiges" "aihexa") or better regexp filter "ai.*\\|acf.*"
   - commands shorter than 4 chars are not allowed with additional chars
     adjust this to -highlighting-level 0
   - Make Ansys mode also working solely with ansys-mode.el
   - make M-C-h more intelligent like M-h (if mark...)
   - speed concern: replace -find-duplicate-p with function argument to
     add-to-list
   - For non-comint-mode usage: display .log file with tail mode
   - is outline-mode enabled? no! make default?, outline
   - take care of setup procedure: v110/ansys/apdl/start110.ans
     /MPLIB,READ,/ansys_inc/v110/ansys/matlib
   - C-c C-v show (optionally) only variables defined up to current
     cursor line.  Make the line number display in
     `ansys-display-variables' (hyper-)links to the corresponding code
     line in the respective APDL file.  (See `occur' function.)  Or
     use the imenu mechanism for this and display the variables in the
     speedbar
   - removing/renaming/checking abort file?
   - Are characters behind unique commands shorter than 4 characters
     possible? No /sol(u) sufficient? Yes condensed input line ($)
     behind commands without arguments possible? Yes have a look in
     -variable-defining-commands!  Warn when - unintentionally -
     arguments are used for Ansys commands which do not allow
     arguments.  Or implement some auto-newline feature?  But
     problematic in condensed command lines or when applying code
     comments!
   - undocumented ask parameter
   - mode-line-format nil);no mode line for this buffer Unambiguous
   - Emacs: old-style backquotes?  used in the old template macro system
   - completion of function names: cursor should end within parentheses
   - better hints for auto-insertion features
   - up/down-block when we are over a begin-keyword and in a block-end
     line
   - component names are fontified as variables! separate them cmlist?
   - format string for *VWRITE: line(s) below, in parens, when FORTRAN
     format specifiers are used, keyword SEQU povides row numbers, up
     to 19 parameters are allowed
   - remove vestiges of ansys-mod.el for making ansys-mode.el GPL
     proof.  Check whether octave-mod.el really is GPL compliant, use
     -ctave-mod.el from 1997, kill octave-mod.el afterwards in
     makefile read every symbol docu string ->NEW_C or _C or OCTAVE_C
   - replace/extend column-ruler with ruler-mode or ruler implemented as
     overlay in buffer
   - make everything completely customisable, eg auto-insert stuff
     customisable enable, Emacs customisation of auto-insert-query
   - Fontify *completion list* distinguishing elements: commands,
     functions and keywords.
   - provide a list of options for the -license function, set this
     function in the defcustom lmstat -a etc.
   - auto-indent-switch as defcustom?
   - inhibit the unnecessary blink-matching-block display when closing a
     block behind a block-end keyword
   - highlight matching block keywords (similar to show-paren-mode) when
     point is at keyword
   - Implement highlighting of bracket pairs with the correct level in
     Ansys GET- and parametric- functions.
   - highlighting of plot commands inside the /GCMD command
   - DEFSUBSTs with DEFUNs inside aren't particularly helpful?
   - Emphasise better implied (colon) loops n,(1:6),(2:12:2) => n,1,2
     $ n,2,4 $... (little used, I know, but any ideas going beyond the
     colon?).
   - startup screen for Ansys mode: Mode help, Ansys version,
     supressing the startup screen 'ansys-mode-startup-message maybe
     as advice when sluggish -> compiliation
   - Enable choice for /show,3d or x11 (-start-graphics)
** Ansys syntax restrictions not (yet) accounted for
   - Parentheses can only be nested 4 levels deep and only up to 9
     operations (+,-,*,...) within these set of parentheses
   - PATH name is restricted to 8 chars
   - *SET parameter strings may only be 32 character long!
   - Character parameters are restricted to only 8 characters.
   - *MSG command can only have 9 additional continuation lines
   - Code line restriction of 640 characters
   - Block level restriction of 20 levels of nested *DO loops (except
     with /INPUT and *USE)
   - Block level restriction of 10 levels of nested *IF blocks
   - Macro level restriction: 20 macros
** Unknown Ansys stuff
   - what the heck is the *UILIST command?
   - Is hyper56 a valid element?
** Additional APDL macro resources
