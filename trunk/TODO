* Bugs:
** User variable highlighting does not take into account
   a.) a clearing of variables and b.) usage of variables before their
   definitions (uninitialised variables) c.) the variable
   fontification clashes with Ansys specifiers

** highlighting of % and & operators in comments 

** functions are not completed with parenthesis (`sin(')

** when there is already a `&' in a format command M-j inserts another one

** -is-unix-sytem must be set for helper functions when
   ansys-mode is not yet invoked like -license-status!
   -check-sytem-type

**  c*** command is not completed

** the command help does not work when there are solver ignored
   characters behind the command


* v12.0.1:
o what is hyper56?
o bug: c*** highlighting,
o write a function for % outside comments, not highlighted in comments!
o condensed input line ($) behind commands without arguments possible?
o Are characters behind unique commands shorter than 4 characters
  possible? /sol(u) sufficient? 
o *goto :branch with character labels such as :1 or :_2 possible?
o update -mode-help README
o clean and sort TODO
o TODOs, FIXMEs in the code
o file coding is unix problematic for windows?
o Dieter's M-h
o load or load-file, what happens with compilation and autoload?
o check whether all undocumented commands are still working in v12
o update emacs wiki, gcode wiki, todo- or org-mode for README, wiki
  formatting!

* Further versions
- replace -find-duplicate-p with function argument to add-to-list

- documentation in info format, better documentation, info file,
  refcard, etc; Emacs help guidelines GNU programming guideline: More
  requires?, indicate replacement of standard Emacs facilities (e. g
  M-C-n, M-C-p), profiling, major mode conventions: multiple loading
  of this mode?.
  
- use abbrev facility for changing deprecated element types

- optimise -start-run with query of y (start immediately),n (exit),e
  (change params),C-h (help)

- read env, try to ask only for the installation directory for the
  ansys-license-file, -program, etc.  variables.  Read some
  information from getenv.  read ansys-license-file from env, supply
  sane standard Ansys values for the helper programs and check for
  existance

- make filter of -license-status optionally  

- substitute text "header" in -variable-view and skeleton-preview for
  an overlay

- C-c C-q sequences are not shown (and stored) in the comint buffer

  - M-?: for commented out variables
  - M-?: unambiguous commands with following, solver ignored characters
  - M-?: following a variable allocation with `='
  - Mohr-Coulomb criterion
  - For non-comint-mode usage: display .log file with tail mode
  - explain what a "logical block" means
  - indent format line? M-j
  - autoinsertion: choice between header only or header with skeleton compilation
  - is outline-mode enabled? no! make default?, outline headers are not complete in skeletons.
  - rework ansys-skeleton and documentation   
  - Skeleton preview read only? currently: writable
  - make outline string in skeletons configurable
  - why an alist with cons cells for try-completion, a list of strings
    should suffice?
  - C-c C-c skips empty lines and comments this is not always
    desirable -> make this optional -> filter process input?
  - take care when region isn't complete in -send-to-ansys (send whole line)

** Killing a buffer with a running process now asks a confirmation.
   You can remove this query in two ways: either removing
   `process-kill-buffer-query-function' from
   `kill-buffer-query-functions' or setting the appropriate process
   flag with `set-process-query-on-exit-flag'.

* improve Ansys interpreter buffer with `comint-mode'
   example: gnuplot-mode
   - Enable one run for every Ansys macro buffer
   - substring-no-properties necessary? Does not seem to be the case...
   - Provide Ansys command completion and command-help in comint buffer
   - Ansys process status is not working properly process-sentinel or
     some comint-hook?  check for EXIT command and wait some time to
     update the mode line run status correctly
   - indicate with activation/inactivation of menu items that an
     asynchronous job is already running or not.
   - show/mark sent lines in apdl file C-c C-u, C-c C-c,
     o with fringes
     o with background
     o maximum line
     o reset highlighting, when?
   - provide Ansys `y' request and carriage return? superflouous?
     a single `y' does the trick

* Dissect skeleton into smaller more useful subjects
  - insert skeleton with C-c C-s when typing twice
  - spider beams, _bolt.mac, screw.mac
  - rework concept with respect to the Ansys menu structure
    sort skeletons in menu
  - Make skeleton-header properly working (info "(autotype)")
  - Optimise templates: completing-read, read-from-minibuffer abbrev `d
    does not indent properly in another block level Implement choice when
    completing *IF commands (*ELSEIF or *ENDIF ?THEN?).
  - Warn when including skeleton in read only file.
  - skeleton for numbering ansys-skeleton-numbering-controls
    (skeleton-insert docu)
  - suggestions with auto-completion of kp,line,area,volu,node,elem,tabn,sval
  - negation, what negation?
  - skeleton for skipping code	 *if,then *else*endif
    if selection: wrap around and indenting
    *go/*if label is not fontified at the command line (restriction of 7 characters with out the colon.)
    must *go:label be unambiguous?

* *set strings may only be 32 character long!
* trigger a timer when showing the ansys-comand-parametr-help
* add cmblock and cm assignments to the variable list

* take care of setup procedure: v110/ansys/apdl/start110.ans
  /MPLIB,READ,/ansys_inc/v110/ansys/matlib

* C-c C-v show (optionally) only variables defined up to current cursor line

* C-j is not skipping to `,' whith default command (from second line onwards)!

* removing/renaming abort file?

* Improve ansys-show-command-parameters
- undocumented aks parameter
- explain also commented out commands   
- Include the _RETURN value of the solid modelling
commands into their help strings of parameter help.  
- mode-line-format nil);no mode line for this buffer Unambiguous
  Ansys commands with additional characters at the end are not found
  in the parameter help (C-c C-h) example: *VWROOOO

12.0.1

0.) update keywords to V12.0
1.) remaining font-lock issues, fontifiction levels
2.) code dissection & gnu coding style
3.) possible language additions
4.) feature freeze & checking
   
* Sluggish font-locking? 12.0.1
- choice of fontification level
- simplify: multi file package -> rework of makefile -> README
   (require 'feature) -> better load-file?

* Rework README generation (from "makefile")
   
* implement C-c { and } like C-x z (repeate) zzzz
   
* Emacs: old-style backquotes?
   used in the old template macro system

*create is only completed by *end

completion of function names: cursor should end within parentheses

?clear message: ansys-mode perform auto insertion?
?condition -highlight in the fontlock variable?

c*** highlighting

comment above user variable problem

*VAR*VAR highlighting problem

==== Important ====

does setting of -hook trigger immediately the effects or is a
restart necessary? other function as well

-up/down-block when we are over a begin-keyword and in a block-end
line

concentrate variable defining functions for user variable search
and - display.  Variables are getting overwritten with Ansys
keywords.

component names also fontified as variables? or separate cmlist?

format string for *VWRITE: line(s) below, in parens, when FORTRAN
format specifiers are used, keyword SEQU povides row numbers, up to
19 parameters are allowed

what the heck is the *UILIST command?

make M-C-h more intelligent like M-h

Enable input directly in the Ansys output buffer (*Ansys*) like in
the *shell*, *math* or *Python* buffer (run-python)
a.) enable highlighting of the *Ansys* buffer -> ansys-interactive-mode
b.) splice any input line behind the BEGIN: symbol in the *Ansys* buffer

remove vestiges of ansys-mod.el for making ansys-mode.el GPL
proof.  Check whether octave-mod.el really is GPL compliant, use
-ctave-mod.el from 1997, kill octave-mod.el afterwards in makefile
read every symbol docu string ->NEW_C or _C or OCTAVE_C

==== Less Important ====

*MSG command can only have 9 additional continuation lines

generalise -insert-pi in code line ($ PI=...), in comment (\n
Pi=...)

replace/extend column-ruler with ruler-mode or ruler implemented as
-verlay in buffer

Capitalized variable fontification clashes with small letter Ansys
predicates.  Fx=3 -> *GET,Fx,fsum,,item,fx, make fontification case
dependent?

startup screen for Ansys mode: Mode help, Ansys version, supressing
the startup screen
'ansys-mode-startup-message
 maybe as advice when sluggish -> compiliation

make everything completely customisable, eg auto-insert stuff
customisable enable Emacs customisation of auto-insert-query and

Fontify *completion list* distinguishing elements: commands,
functions and keywords.

provide a list of options for the -license function, set this
function in the defcustom lmstat -a etc.

-optimisation (look at regexp with *), nested repetition regexp
-operators
-start-ansys

finding an Ansys /filnam command in current macro file
and suggesting this as current job-name optionally
kill old job when called again with working run
warn and optionally remove the ansys lock file before starting a run

Enable choice for /show,3d or x11 (-start-graphics)

Wrong highlighting of variables in /com, C*** text strings
variable highlighting overwrites ansys commands with the same name
dynamic highlighting is only implemented for .mac files

*DO parameters are not restricted to the respective block deleting
parameters with `PARAM=' or `*SET,PARAM,' is not taken into account
when dynamically highlighting user variables.  Redefinition of
variables leaves the old definitions valid ->invalidate
font-locking there.  Variable highlighting in strings is not
working (string substitution).  display-user-variables displays
message strings as well

make the line number display in `ansys-display-variables'
(hyper-)links to the corresponding code line in the respective APDL
file.  (See `occur' function.)  Or use the imenu mechanism for this
and display the variables in the speedbar

auto-indent-switch as defcustom?

inhibit the unnecessary blink-matching-block display when closing a
block behind a block-end keyword

highlight matching block keywords (similar to show-paren-mode) when
point is at keyword

Implement highlighting of brackets with the correct level in Ansys
GET- and parametric- functions.

highlighting of plot commands inside the /GCMD command

Warn when - unintentionally - arguments are used for Ansys commands
which do not allow arguments.  Or implement some auto-newline
feature?  But problematic in condensed command lines
-r when applying code comments!

Indicate that character parameters are restricted to only 8
characters.

DEFSUBSTs with DEFUNs inside aren't particularly helpful?

see www.apdl.de for further ideas and extensions

Emphasise better implied (colon) loops n,(1:6),(2:12:2) => n,1,2 $
n,2,4 $... (little used, I know, but any ideas going beyond the
colon?).

Code line restriction of 640 characters is not taken care of.
Block level restriction of 20 levels of nested *DO loops (except
with /INPUT and *USE)
Block level restriction of 10 levels of nested *IF blocks
Macro level restriction: 20 macros

# local variables:
# mode: outline
