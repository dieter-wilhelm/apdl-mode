ABS(x) Absolute value of x.  
SIGN(x,y) Absolute value of x with sign of y. y=0 results in positive sign.  
CXABS(x,y) Absolute value of the complex number x + y
EXP(x)  Exponential of x (ex).  
LOG(x)  Natural log of x (ln (x)).  
LOG10(x)  Common log of x (log10(x)).  
SQRT(x)  Square root of x.  
NINT(x)  Nearest integer to x.  
MOD(x,y) Remainder of x/y. y=0 returns zero (0).  
RAND(x,y)  Random number (uniform distribution) in the range x to y (x = lower bound, y = upper bound).  
GDIS(x,y)  Random sample of a Gaussian (normal) distribution with mean x and standard deviation y.  
SIN(x), COS(x), TAN(x)  Sine, Cosine, and Tangent of x. x is in radians by default, but can be changed to degrees with *AFUN.  
COS(x), TAN(x)  Sine, Cosine, and Tangent of x. x is in radians by default, but can be changed to degrees with *AFUN.  
TAN(x)  Sine, Cosine, and Tangent of x. x is in radians by default, but can be changed to degrees with *AFUN.  
SINH(x), COSH(x), TANH(x)  Hyperbolic sine, Hyperbolic cosine, and Hyperbolic tangent of x.  
COSH(x), TANH(x)  Hyperbolic sine, Hyperbolic cosine, and Hyperbolic tangent of x.  
TANH(x)  Hyperbolic sine, Hyperbolic cosine, and Hyperbolic tangent of x.  
ASIN(x), ACOS(x), ATAN(x)  Arcsine, Arccosine, and Arctangent of x. x must be between -1.0 and +1.0 for ASIN and ACOS. Output is in radians by default, but can be changed to degrees with *AFUN. Range of output is -pi/2 to +pi/2 for ASIN and ATAN, and 0 to pi for ACOS.  
ACOS(x), ATAN(x)  Arcsine, Arccosine, and Arctangent of x. x must be between -1.0 and +1.0 for ASIN and ACOS. Output is in radians by default, but can be changed to degrees with *AFUN. Range of output is -pi/2 to +pi/2 for ASIN and ATAN, and 0 to pi for ACOS.  
ATAN(x)  Arcsine, Arccosine, and Arctangent of x. x must be between -1.0 and +1.0 for ASIN and ACOS. Output is in radians by default, but can be changed to degrees with *AFUN. Range of output is -pi/2 to +pi/2 for ASIN and ATAN, and 0 to pi for ACOS.  
ATAN2(y,x)  Arctangent of y/x with the sign of each component considered. Output is in radians by default, but can be changed to degrees with *AFUN. Range of output is -pi to +pi.  
VALCHR (CPARM Numerical value of CPARM (if CPARM is non-numeric, returns 0.0).  
CHRVAL (PARM)  Character value of numerical parameter PARM. Number of decimal places depends on magnitude.  
UPCASE CPARM Upper case equivalent of CPARM. 
LWCASE (CPARM) Lower case equivalent of CPARM.
